A Different Christmas is the debut extended play by American singer Bryson Tiller. It was released through RCA Records on November 19, 2021. The EP features guest appearances from Kiana Ledé, Justin Bieber, Poo Bear, Tayla Parx, and Tiller's daughter, Halo. It marks the first time that Tiller has worked with any of the featured artists on the EP. Production was handled by Tiller himself, Poo Bear himself, Teddy Walton, Carter Lang, J-Louis, Cool & Dre, Emoko, Nes, the Audibles, Sasha Sirota, Oliver "Junior" Frid, and Jeff "Gitty" Gitelman. The project debuted and peaked at number 194 on the Billboard 200 for the chart week ending December 4, 2021. The EP was supported by one single, "Lonely Christmas", which features Justin Bieber and Poo Bear, and was released alongside a music video with the release of the EP. ==Background and promotion== On November 10, 2021, Tiller announced the project. Within the post, he stated that it was inspired by fellow singers Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande and their Christmas music that they have released previously. The tracklist was revealed exactly a week later, on November 17, 2021. Tiller told Essence that he came up with the project when thinking about how it feels to spend Christmas alone and it is specially made for his fans who are spending the holidays by themselves. It was also inspired by past events in his personal life. While creating the project, he recalled that he thought about how it feels to spend Christmas alone, which he has done that before. His purpose of the EP is to let his fans know that they are not alone for Christmas even if they are spending it alone. He also wanted to be on different instrumentals than what he regularly sings on. All seven tracks from the EP consist of a "combination of soul samples with his patented trap- like snares [drums]". The lead and only single, "Lonely Christmas", featuring Justin Bieber and American singer-songwriter and record producer Poo Bear, was released with a music video on November 19, 2021. ==Track listing== Notes * Every track is stylized in all lowercase.
