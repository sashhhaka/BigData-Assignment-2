Ernest Thesiger, as Bertram Tully, was the outstanding character of the film, and his facial expressions were truly wonderful achievements”; while Cinema Chat wrote, "It’s a perfect scream from start to finish, and the acting in several of the ludicrous scenes is clever - that’s the very word for it. We believe that this is Ernest Thesiger’s first appearance in the movies.” ==References== ==Bibliography== * Low, Rachael. History of the British Film, 1918-1929.
