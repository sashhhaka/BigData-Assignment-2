At Metacritic, the album received an above average score of 66 out of 100. In a 4-star review written by Rolling Stone editor Jody Rosen he stated, "The boys fantastic third album is steeped in the fuzzed-up guitars, three-part harmonies and cotton-candy choruses of Big Star and Cheap Trick. Power-pop die-hards awaiting the genre's commercial saviors must reckon with the fact that the messiahs have arrived". Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "The third album from the alpha boy band of the moment is certainly of the moment. Jersey-born Jonas siblings Nick (15), Kevin (20), and Joe (18) hit all the right pop notes with such numbers as the romping come-on 'Got Me Going Crazy', the slightly funky 'Burnin' Up' (a very pale imitation of Prince) and the emo- lite of brokenhearted ballad 'Can't Have You'. In a mixed review from the Toronto Star, Ben Rayner when speaking about the albums demographic wrote, "Young hearts will melt, elder stomachs will churn", and "[A Little Bit Longer] has one uncritical audience in particular in mind and it serves it as well as can be expected". ==Track listing== ==Exclusive DVDs== ;Target Exclusive DVD The Target edition of A Little Bit Longer includes a DVD with the following: *"JB Rules" *Live videos from the Disney Channel Games 2008: ** "S.O.S." ** "Burnin' Up" ** "This Is Me" (with Demi Lovato) ;Jonas Brothers official site pre-order bonus DVD Fans that pre-ordered A Little Bit Longer online before its release received a DVD with the following: *Jonas Brothers' special message *A Little Bit Longer album piece *"A Little Bit Longer" (acoustic live performance) *"Lovebug" (acoustic performance) *Band in a Bus trailer *Jonas Brothers YouTube videos ;Woolworths (UK) Exclusive DVD Buyers of the CD had the option to get an exclusive DVD at extra cost, As they did with "Jonas Brothers" & "Camp Rock" *Jonas Brothers' special message *A Little Bit Longer album piece *Band in a Bus trailer *Jonas Brothers YouTube videos ;UK "FanPack" Released in the UK, a limited edition Fan pack containing *Regular version of the album cd *Girls skinny fit teeshirt *Tote bag *Bracelet *4 Pin Badges *All contained inside a clear vanity case with Jonas Brothers emblem ;Canadian deluxe edition The Canadian Deluxe Edition of A Little Bit Longer includes a DVD with the following: * Live @ Much: Jonas Brothers- A MuchMusic Special Presentation * A Little Bit Longer Album Piece * Band in a Bus Trailer * Jonas Brothers YouTube videos; ** DJ Danger ** Nick J Show – Anger ** Tai Chi ** Nick J Show – Revenge ** Gibson Surprise Visit ** Look Me in the Eyes Makes History ** Meet the Queen * Music videos ** "Burnin' Up" ** "Lovebug" ==Personnel== * Nick Jonas – lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums * Joe Jonas – lead vocals, guitar * Kevin Jonas – background vocals, guitar, mandolin * John Lloyd Taylor – guitar, background vocals * John Fields – bass, keyboards, guitar * Dorian Crozier – drums, percussion, programming * Stephen Lu - string arrangements, conducting * Justin Salter – assistant engineer * Meaghan Martin - vocals on "Video Girl" * Robert "Big Rob" Feggans- rap vocals on "Burnin' Up" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2008) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 13 Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 27 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) 75 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) 58 Brazil Albums (ABPD) 1 Canadian Albums (Billboard) 1 Croatian Albums (IFPI) 30 Danish Albums (Tracklisten) 38 Dutch Albums (MegaCharts) 40 French Albums (SNEP) 14 German Albums (Media Control Charts) 23 Greek Albums (IFPI) 21 Hungarian Albums (MAHASZ) 39 Irish Albums (IRMA) 15 Italian Albums (FIMI) 2 Japanese Albums (Oricon) 35 Mexican Albums (AMPROFON) 1 New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) 11 Norwegian Albums (VG-lista) 27 Polish Albums (ZPAV) 6 Portuguese Albums (AFP) 27 Scottish Albums (OCC) 22 Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) 3 Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan) 54 Swiss Albums (Swiss Hitparade) 55 Taiwan Albums (G-Music) 15 UK Albums (OCC) 19 US Billboard 200 1 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2008) Position US Billboard 200 25 Chart (2009) Position US Billboard 200 77 ==Certifications and sales== ==Release history== Country Date United States August 12, 2008 Canada Brazil Argentina August 21, 2008 Colombia Hong Kong August 26, 2008 United Kingdom September 29, 2008 Europe October 3, 2008 Philippines October 6, 2008 Australia October 13, 2008 New Zealand October 13, 2008 South Africa November 14, 2008 Taiwan November 14, 2008 Canada (Deluxe Edition) December 9, 2008 Japan January 14, 2009 ==References== ==External links== *Jonas Brothers official website *Jonas Brothers official MySpace Category:2008 albums Category:Jonas Brothers albums Category:Hollywood Records albums Category:Albums produced by John Fields (record producer)
