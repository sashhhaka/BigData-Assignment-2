The theme of the play revolves around a seemingly bitter and cynical idea: a woman should become a prostitute, to sustain itself without effort. Josinalda, a lady of strict principles, maintains in his house with his meager salary, Liduina, your sister, Fredegund, your niece, and Creuzilene, your neighbor . Life is peaceful and marked by seemingly commons issues until, unexpectedly, a bandit enters the residence of distinguished ladies, making them hostages. The play then becomes a police comedy, and thus a fascinating intellectual game of cat and mouse, where not everything looks, like really is.COUTINHO, Afrânio; SOUSA, J. Galante de.
