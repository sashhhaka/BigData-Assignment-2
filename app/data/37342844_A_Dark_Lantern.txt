This, together with the blow of her father's death, shatters Katherine's nerves and causes a breakdown. She recovers under the rigid administrations of Dr. Garth Vincent (Crane). Her attitude of antagonistic exaggeration of his sternness that conceives it as sheer brutality makes her submission to the deep love he bears her a sorrowful task. His patience at last breaks her embittered spirit and sends her to his home, willing to accept his protection under compromising circumstances. The realness of his affection is at last revealed to her and Prince Anton, whose love for Katherine has made him risk his throne by divorcing his wife, is sent back to Argovinia. ==Cast== *Alice Brady as Katherine Dereham *James Crane as Dr. Garth Vincent *Reginald Denny as Prince Anton *Brandon Hurst as Colonel Dereham *Marie Burke as Lady Peterborough *David Monterno as Graf-Wilhelm *Carolyn Irwin as Mrs. Hally *Mrs. Tony West as Mrs. Todine *Roni Pursell as Princess Margaretha *Russell McDermott as Leonard *Virginia Huppert as Nurse for Katherine *Dorothy Betts as Natalie, Maid ==References== ==External links== * *Lantern slide; A Dark Lantern Category:1920 films Category:Films directed by John S.
