thumb|A Different Thread (Alicia Best and Robert Jackson) in Paris, 2021 alt=|thumb|A Different Thread (Robert Jackson, Alicia Best) A Different Thread is an English-American band from Lichfield, Staffordshire, England and Durham, North Carolina, USA. The core members — Alicia Best and Robert Jackson — first met by chance, while busking in Galway, Ireland in 2016. They were performing on the same street and started singing together. Soon after, they began collaborating, while touring throughout Europe and the USA. They live a nomadic lifestyle, which is in part, due to the transatlantic nature of the band. They are known for their DIY approach, minimalist ethos, modern vintage style, and nostalgic sound. Their songs deal with themes of love, loss, polyamory, wanderlust, authentic human connection, saudade, freedom, change, and social justice. ==Members== *Robert Jackson (born April 6, 1989) Nuneaton UK - Vocals, Guitar, Harmonica, Banjo, Keys.
