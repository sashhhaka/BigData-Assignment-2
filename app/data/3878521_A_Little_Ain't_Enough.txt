A Little Ain't Enough is the third full-length studio album by David Lee Roth, released on January 15, 1991, through Warner Music Group. It was certified gold on April 11, 1991. Produced by Bob Rock, the album featured the lead guitar work of Jason Becker, a then up-and-coming guitarist who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, aka Lou Gehrig's disease) a week after joining the band. He managed to finish recording the album, but was unable to tour in support of the album, as his condition left him with little strength in his hands. The album marked the beginning of Roth's commercial decline, given the drop-off in sales from his prior two albums. During the year of the album's release, the Seattle grunge movement was beginning a sea- change in rock, and Roth's brand of glam metal was considered, by mainstream audiences, obsolete. Although the album went out of print on the Warner Bros. label in 1996, it was later reissued (in remastered form) in 2007 through the Friday Music label. == Release == A music video for the title track, "A Lil' Ain't Enough" received significant play on MTV. The song "Hammerhead Shark" is a cover and partial re-write of the song by the same title from the 1990 album "Walking on a Wire" by Lowen & Navarro. == Tour == The tour supporting the record was successful in Europe but the American leg, supported by Extreme and Cinderella, turned into a financial failure, with low attendance and one-third of the shows cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Setlists were shortened and songs from the current album dropped as the US tour went on. The touring band featured Ozzy Osbourne and Lizzy Borden guitarist Joe Holmes, bassist Todd Jensen from Hardline, longtime collaborators Gregg Bissonette and Brett Tuggle, and for the first few shows Desi Rexx from D'Molls as second guitarist. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * David Lee Roth – vocals, harmonica, concept * Jason Becker – lead guitar * Steve Hunter – slide guitar, rhythm guitar * Paul Baron – brass * Gregg Bissonette – drums, percussion * Matt Bissonette – bass, vocals * Derry Byrne – brass * Brian Dobbs – engineer * Tom Keenlyside – brass * Marc LaFrance – backing vocals * George Marino – mastering * Jim McGillveray – percussion * Ian Putz – brass * Bob Rock – producer, mixing * Randy Staub – engineer * David Steele – backing vocals * Chris Taylor – engineer * Brett Tuggle – keyboards, vocals * John Webster – keyboards * Pete Angelus – concept * Jim Pezzullo – art direction, design ==Charts== Chart (1991) Peak position Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista) 1 Japanese Albums (Oricon) 17 ==Certifications== ==References== Category:David Lee Roth albums Category:1991 albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Rock Category:Glam metal albums
