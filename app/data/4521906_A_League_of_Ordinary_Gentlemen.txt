He now runs Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl in Columbus, Ohio, and for several years ran a karaoke business on the side. He later joined the PBA Senior Tour (for players age 50 and older, now named the PBA50 Tour), and made a splash by winning the 2008 Senior U.S. Open. In 2010, he was named PBA Senior Player of the Year. Chris Barnes earned his first-ever PBA Player of the Year award in the 2007-08 season. He twice won what was (at the time) the biggest prize check in the history of televised bowling ($200,000) by winning the Motel 6 Roll to Riches events in 2005 and 2006. Barnes was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 2018, and won his 19th PBA Tour title later that year. In September, 2006, Walter Ray Williams Jr. surpassed Earl Anthony for first place on the PBA's All-Time titles list with his win over Pete Weber in the Dydo Japan Cup. Walter earned 47 PBA Tour titles (the most all-time), with his final title coming at the USBC Masters in February, 2010. He retired from the standard PBA Tour in 2021 at age 61, but still participates on the PBA50 Tour. In August of 2021, Williams won his 15th PBA50 Tour title, surpassing John Handegard for the most titles all-time on that tour. He is still going strong on the PBA50 Tour at age 63, winning his 16th title in the 2022 season. As of 2022, Pete Weber is fourth on the PBA's all-time list with 37 titles, with his most recent title coming at age 50 in the PBA Tournament of Champions on March 31, 2013. At the time, that victory tied Weber with Earl Anthony for the most major championships in PBA Tour history (10). A year earlier (2012), Weber won his record fifth U.S. Open title.Vint, Bill.
