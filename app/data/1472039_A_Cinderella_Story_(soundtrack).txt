She praised Duff's songs, noting that they "display a little more edge and depth while still remaining appropriate for a teen pop singer like Duff and her audience," and added that they were complemented by the contributions from other artists. She claimed that Duff contributing to the majority of the album would "tide [her] fans over" before the release of her eponymous third album. Phares finalized her review stating, "A Cinderella Story is an admittedly lightweight but solidly entertaining soundtrack that delivers exactly what its audience wants from it." ==Track listing== Notes * signifies an executive producer * signifies a vocal producer and executive producer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2004) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2004) Position US Billboard 200 172 US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard) 10 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Release dates and formats for A Cinderella Story Region Date Format Label Canada July 13, 2004 CD Universal United States Hollywood United Kingdom August 23, 2004 Warner Australia September 13, 2004 Festival Mushroom Archived copy Japan November 3, 2004 Avex Trax == References == Category:Hilary Duff albums Category:Albums produced by Chico Bennett Category:2004 soundtrack albums Category:Hollywood Records soundtracks Category:Romance film soundtracks Category:Comedy film soundtracks Category:A Cinderella Story (film series)
