They give him a choice between driving the taxi while they commit robberies or riding in the trunk, using the phrase "Wheel or trunk." This makes Ulises a member of their gang. After several failed and some successful robberies, Ulises begins to receive a share of the loot. What he once believed was immoral and wrong becomes normalized for him. The robbers even stay in Ulises' home and give gifts to his family, leading them to also cover up for the gang. Soon, Ulises must choose between the benefits and drawbacks of this new lifestyle. ==Cast== * Daniel Muñoz as Chavelo * Alejandro Trejo as Ulises * Fernando Gómez-Rovira as Coto * Ivonne Becerra as Almacenera * Elsa Poblete as Nelly * Daniel Alcaíno as TV journalist * Felipe Ortega as Amaro * Edgardo Carvajal as Ronny * Denitze Lecaros as Javiera * Víctor Rojas as Hugo Soto * Gerardo Orchard as Julián Castro * Lorena Prada as office secretary * Cristián Quezada as Inspector Padilla * René Castro as Inspector Romero * Marío Escobar as "Bala Fría" * Iban Ayala as Evangélico * Juan Rodríguez as Tricycle boy ==See also== *List of submissions to the 74th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 films Category:2000s Spanish-language films Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films Category:Chilean comedy-drama films Category:2001 comedy films Category:2001 drama films
