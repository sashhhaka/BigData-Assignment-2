Kennedy Jr. and published on August 2, 2022 by Skyhorse Publishing. == Synopsis == The book is critical of the Democratic Party, accusing its leadership of lacking critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, and faith in science. Kennedy accuses the party of accepting the government's public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, which he paints as propaganda and unscientific. The book advocates to liberal Americans to protect the civil liberties and the First Amendment, and to reject what the author describes as cancel culture. == Critical reception == The claims in the book are described in Current Affairs as "deceptive, bogus, and easily refuted." Current Affairs refutes Kennedy's assertions that vaccines cause autism and that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are effective treatments for COVID-19. The American Conservative magazine described Kennedy's message as urgent. == See also == * Children's Health Defense * COVID-19 misinformation by the United States * The Real Anthony Fauci (by the same author) * Vaccines and autism == References == Category:2022 non-fiction books Category:Skyhorse Publishing books Category:Books by Robert F.
