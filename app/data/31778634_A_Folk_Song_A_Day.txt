A Folk Song a Day is a project by the English folk singer and musician and Bellowhead member Jon Boden where he recorded and released a folk song each day for one year. The project ended on 24 June 2011. ==About== The project started on 24 June 2010. It has resulted in 12 digital albums (one for each month). Boden hopes that it will promote social singing and be a resource for those looking for inspiration. The songs can be bought in the form of digital download from Amazon or from iTunes. The project reached number one in the iTunes music podcast in its first week. ==The songs== ;A Folk Song A Day 1: July 2010 * Tyne Of Harrow 05:18 * The Hunt Is Up 03:06 * I Wish That The Wars Were
