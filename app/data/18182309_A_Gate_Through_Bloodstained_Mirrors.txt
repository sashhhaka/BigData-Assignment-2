A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors is a 2001 demo by the American black metal one-man-band Xasthur. Reviews of that release, first published by Profane Productions as a limited CD-R edition of 150 copies, proved to be positive, comparing the material to old Graveland and Burzum. With the increasing cult status of Xasthur, the demo was reissued by Total Holocaust Records, featuring a different mix and track list (CD and cassette, 2004). This edition was also published as a double-12" vinyl release by Debemur Morti Productions (2004) and finally by Hydra Head Records (double-CD release, the second CD containing further rare material, 2008). The record is rumored to have influenced at least one suicide. ==Track listing of the original demo (2001)== #Intro – 01:16 #Moon Shrouded in Misery, Part 1 – 6:46 #Suicide in Dark Serenity – 10:39 #Dwell Beneath the Woods of Evil – 5:14 #Cursed Be the Memory of Light – 7:04 #Possession of Desolate Magick – 5:40 #Storms of Red Revenge – 4:16 #A Spell Within the Winds – 4:34 #Summon the End of Time – 4:52 #Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors – 8:32 #Kingdom of Burning Crucifixions – 4:21 #Moon Shrouded in Misery, Part 2 – 1:47 #Black Spell of Destruction / Channeling the Power of Souls Into a New God – 7:34 Burzum cover. ==Total Holocaust Records release (2004)== For this first official release as a regular CD, all the tracks of the demo (which was originally published in mono) were remixed in 2003.
