"A Life on the Ocean Wave" is a poem-turned-song by Epes Sargent published in 1838 and set to music by Henry Russell. It is the iconic Regimental March of His Majesty's Royal Marines. ==Origin of the poem and song== One day Sargent was walking on The Battery in New York City watching the ships enter the harbour. This scene inspired Sargent to write a poem, which Russell later put to music. The song soon became popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States. ==Lyrics== ==History of cultural uses of the song== At an 1851 celebration in Salem, Massachusetts, the Boston Cadet Band gave the new clipper ship Witch of the Wave a lively sendoff by striking up "A Life on the Ocean Wave" as the SS R. B. Forbes towed the new clipper out to set sail for Boston. The tune, slightly altered, provides the music for the Latter-day Saint hymn "Who's On The Lord's Side?""Who's On The Lord's Side?" (Hymn 260), Hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1985. ==References== ==External links== * Thurl Ravenscroft-- Life On The Ocean Waves, Video with music and pictures * A Life on the Ocean Wave, Sound clip and links to sheet music, as featured in the Laura Ingalls Wilder book By the Shores of Silver Lake Category:British military marches Category:Royal Marines Category:Royal Marines Band Service Category:1838 songs Category:Songs with music by Henry Russell (musician) Category:Songs based on poems
