His best friend Craig (Shawn Roberts) and sister Sarah (Kristen Hager) accompany Steve to their family's cabin in the hopes of convincing him that she's not right for him, but with no success. When Steve is infected with a strange virus via a mosquito bite, he begins to turn into a zombie and hunger for brains. Despite this new turn of events, all Tina cares about is getting married and doesn't care that Steve is starting to miss various body parts. Now Steve must try to control his new urges while also trying to avoid a zombie hunter (Stephen McHattie) out to end his existence. ==Cast== *Kristopher Turner as Steve *Crystal Lowe as Tina *Shawn Roberts as Craig *Kristen Hager as Sarah *Stephen McHattie as Max *Emilie Ullerup as Penelope Pendleton *George Buza as Capt'n Cletus *Robert Maillet as Terry 'Terror' Thompkins *Neil Whitely as The Professor *Spider Allen as Ringmaster *Melanie Rainville as Bearded Lady *Richard Rowntree as BBQ Bill *Trevor Martin as Master Baiter / Cory Cortex *Christopher Bond as Pizza Guy *Rob Roy as Battered Local ==Reception== Critical reception for A Little Bit Zombie has been predominantly positive.
