He's in love with Shingo of course! But all is about to be revealed, because when Shingo's just-as-impressive cousin comes into town, Koji realizes he'll have to confess everything or risk losing his one true love forever... ==Publication== Kadokawa Shoten released the manga on January 29, 2004.

Pop Shock Culture's Isaac Hale commends the manga for its "adorable humor [which] is abundant in every story". Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux comments on the manga artist's use of "a variety of moods, techniques, and styles to give her stories a variety of temperatures â€“ from hot and sexy to adorable and funny". ==References== Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:2004 manga Category:Manga anthologies Category:Josei manga Category:Yaoi anime and manga
