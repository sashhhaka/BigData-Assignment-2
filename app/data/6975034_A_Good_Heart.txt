"A Good Heart" is a song by Northern Irish singer Feargal Sharkey, released as the first single from his self-titled debut album. It was released in September 1985 and became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, and Ireland. ==Background== Written by then-Lone Justice frontwoman Maria McKee about her relationship with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers keyboard player Benmont Tench and produced by the Eurythmics' David A. Stewart, this was former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey's third solo single. The song was Sharkey's only number one single and stayed at the top of the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in November 1985. However, it fared less well in the US, peaking at No. 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sharkey followed up the single with the Tench-written "You Little Thief". This song was allegedly about Tench's side of the relationship with McKee. However, Tench denies the song is about McKee. Austin, Texas-based singer- songwriter/guitarist Kris McKay performed a version of the song, featured on the soundtrack for the 1989 Patrick Swayze movie Road House. In 2007, McKee released her own recording of the track on her album Late December. ==Formats== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1985â€“1986) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 1 Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) 5 Italy (Musica e dischi) Set Tipo to Singoli, then enter Feargal Sharkey into the Arista field and click cerca. 18 Portugal (AFP) 2 South Africa (Springbok Radio) 3 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1985) Position UK Singles (OCC) 8 Chart (1986) Position Australia (Kent Music Report) 8 Belgium (Ultratop) 24 Canada Top Singles (RPM) 51 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 13 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 49 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 9 South Africa (Springbok Radio) 15 West Germany (Official German Charts) 41 ==Sales and certifications== ==Release history== Region Date Format(s) Label(s) United Kingdom 30 September 1985 Virgin United States February 1986 A&M; ==References== Category:1985 songs Category:1985 singles Category:A&M; Records singles Category:Dutch Top 40 number-one singles Category:Feargal Sharkey songs Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:Song recordings produced by Dave Stewart (musician and producer) Category:Songs written by Maria McKee Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Virgin Records singles
