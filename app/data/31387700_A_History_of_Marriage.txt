thumb|First edition A History of Marriage, published by Penguin Canada in 2009, is a non-fiction book by Elizabeth Abbott, the Canadian author of A History of Celibacy (1999) and A History of Mistresses (2003) that combines general history and personal histories of marriage.

Some topics covered are relative ages at which various societies from Chinese to Mormon married off their girls; details of the satisfying marriage of Martin Luther and former nun Katharina von Bora; the ruptured family units of Native American children removed to residential schools; the popularity of so-called Boston marriages (depicted by Henry James in The Bostonians) between like-minded women who resisted conventional marriage but weren't necessarily lesbian; and the scarcity of sponges used for contraception by Northern women during the Civil War because of the cut-off in supply from Florida.Kirkus Reviews March 1st, 2011 A History of Marriage was a finalist for the 2010 Governor General's Literary Award for non-fiction.Canada Council for the Arts. == References == Category:Canadian non-fiction books Category:Books about marriage Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:Penguin Books books
