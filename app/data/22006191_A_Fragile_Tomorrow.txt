A Fragile Tomorrow is an American alternative/powerpop band from Charleston, South Carolina, United States, formerly from Montgomery, New York. The group formed in 2003 and included brothers Sean Kelly, Dom Kelly, and Brendan Kelly. In 2006, bassist Shaun Rhoades joined the group. The band has put out six studio albums, most recently the critically acclaimed Make Me Over in 2015 and Generation Loss in 2019. As of 2020, they were working on their seventh record and third MPress Records release. The band has shared the stage with/opened for Indigo Girls, The Bangles, Matthew Sweet, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Garrison Starr, Antigone Rising, K's Choice, Drivin N Cryin, Continental Drifters, Blues Traveler, The Cowsills, Danielle Howle, Susan Cowsill, Amy Ray, and more. ==Early years== The band was first formed by brothers Sean, Dominic, and Brendan Kelly. Sean and Dominic are two of triplets, all diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy as infants, and their fraternal triplet died when they were 6. After first becoming a band in 2003, three years later, they had enough material for an album, which led to their 2006 debut. Soon after the release, bassist Shaun Rhoades was added to the group. After ending their recording/management contract with Audem Records in early 2007, the band began work on their sophomore release Beautiful Noise, which was released independently in 2008. Touring in support of this release led to the band deciding to relocate from their hometown of Montgomery, NY to Charleston, SC. The band began recording the follow-up to 2008's Beautiful Noise, titled Tripping Over Nothing, which was produced by South Carolina musician Danielle Howle in the summer of 2009. The album features guest appearances once again by Peter Holsapple and Susan Cowsill, as well as Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls. Consistent touring in Charleston, coupled with time spent in the area recording their third album, prompted the band to relocate to the Charleston area in late 2009, where they have since remained. The album was released on February 23, 2010. The band put out the record on their own label, Piewillie Records. They toured heavily in support of it, opening for Indigo Girls In December 2010, the band released a digital EP of acoustic versions of songs from Tripping Over Nothing, titled Palmetto EP. Sean and Dom were featured vocalists on an Indigo Girls live release, titled "Staring Down the Brilliant Dream" which was released in June 2010. Additionally, they sing on the song "Closer to Fine" along with Michelle Malone and actress Jill Hennessy. In February 2011, the band went back out on the road with Indigo Girls, opening the southeast leg of their tour. On April 19, 2011, the band released a live record called Live at Awendaw Green that was recorded at a show in Awendaw, SC in December 2010.
