"A Fifth of Beethoven" is a disco instrumental recorded by Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band, adapted from the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. The record was produced by production music and sound effects recording producer Thomas J. Valentino. The "Fifth" in the song's title is a pun, referencing a liquid measure approximately equal to one-fifth of a gallon, a popular size for bottles containing liquor, as well as Beethoven's Fifth Symphony from which the song was adapted. Released as a single by Private Stock Records in 1976, the song debuted at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and climbed to number 1 within 19 weeks, remaining there for one week. In 1977, it was licensed to RSO Records for inclusion on the best- selling Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. The song is one of Murphy's few Top 40 hits. ==Background and recording== In college, Murphy's interests included rock music, particularly that which was adapted from classical music, such as "Joy" by Apollo 100 and "A Lover's Concerto" by The Toys. Later, in 1976, while writing a disco song for a commercial, a producer suggested the idea of "updating classical music", which "nobody [has] done lately". He then recorded a demo tape of five songs—three were ordinary pop songs, while the fourth was a disco rendition of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony titled "A Fifth of Beethoven"—mailing it to various record labels in New York City. The response was underwhelming, but "Fifth" caught the interest of Private Stock Records owner Larry Uttal. Murphy signed on to Private Stock and recorded the album A Fifth of Beethoven, containing the title track and first single of the same name. The single was credited to "Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band" upon encouragement from Private Stock, which believed it would be more successful if credited to a group rather than an individual. However, two days following the record's release, Private Stock discovered the existence of another Big Apple Band (which promptly changed its name to Chic). The record was later re- released and credited to "The Walter Murphy Band", then simply to "Walter Murphy". ==Reception== "A Fifth of Beethoven" started at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 and eventually reached number 1 within 19 weeks, where it stayed for one week. The single sold two million copies, while the album sold about 750,000 copies. The second single, a rendition of Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee", titled "Flight '76", reached number 44 on the Hot 100. In addition to Saturday Night Fever, it appears in a heavily edited form in the movie House of Gucci. It is used as the theme of the television miniseries Mrs. America. ==In popular culture== The music was used in a recruitment campaign by the Irish Defence Forces in the early 1980s. ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1976) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 15 South Africa (Springbok Radio) 14 US Billboard Hot 100 1 US Billboard Hot Disco Singles 10 US Billboard Hot Soul Singles 10 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 13 US Cash Box 1 US Record World 1 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1976) Rank Australia (Kent Music Report) 91 Canada Top Singles (RPM) 8 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 25 US Billboard Hot 100 10 US Cash Box 6 ===All-time charts=== Chart (1958–2018) Position US Billboard Hot 100 120 ===Certifications=== ==See also== *List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1976 *List of Cash Box Top 100 number-one singles of 1976 *List of number-one singles of 1976 (Canada) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 singles Category:1976 songs Category:1970s instrumentals Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Cashbox number-one singles Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:Disco songs Category:Cultural depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven Category:Pop instrumentals Category:Private Stock Records singles Category:Songs from Saturday Night Fever Category:Songs written by Walter Murphy Category:Popular songs based on classical music
