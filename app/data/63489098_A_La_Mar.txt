A La Mar is the second studio album by Dominican musician Vicente García, released on August 26, 2016. ==Background and accolades== The album marks García's first collaboration with Calle 13 producer Visitante. The collaboration inspired García to deviate from mainstream bachata and incorporate a variety of genres into the album: the artist recalled, "I [didn't] want to be that guy that just does Caribbean music". García won three awards including Best New Artist at the 2017 Latin Grammy Awards. The song "Bachata en Kingston" from A La Mar won Best Tropical Song at the ceremony.
