thumb|250px|Eric (left) and Joey (right) A Couple of Guys was a comic strip about the lives of a gay male couple, their friends and family in New York City. The strip was first published in September 1996 and was written and drawn by Dave Brousseau. The strip ended in February 2018 because of high production costs and Brousseu's wishes. == History == The strip was first published in the now-defunct Weekly News, a gay newspaper in Miami, Florida, in September 1996. It was syndicated in June 1996 and was published in newspapers across the United States. and on several websites. Brousseau said that two of the characters, Eric's sister and brother-in-law, first appeared in a comic strip he drew in college. Mary Ann Parker and Marty Dinkleman were supporting characters in Guy Average, Average Guy, which also appeared in the Xavier University Newswire. However, the later Marty was somewhat different from the previous incarnation in that the college version was never openly homophobic, had curly hair, and was not a native New Yorker. ==Cast== ===Main characters=== * Eric Parker: An actor and waiter originally from Columbus, Ohio. Eric is basically a good person, but can be at times overly-sensitive and quick-tempered. He has an active imagination, and sometimes launches into elaborate daydreams. * Joey Romelli: A New York City police officer and the boyfriend of Eric. Joey is much more practical and even-tempered than Eric, and often tries to convince his boyfriend to see things from other people's point of view. Joey has one sister, Gina, who lives in New York, and two brothers, Vincent and Anthony, who live elsewhere. * Sue Fletcher: Eric and Joey's neighbor in their apartment building. She is an English professor at New York University and is known for using stilted language. She is a bit of an intellectual snob and tends to patronize others, particularly Eric. * Simone Curtis: Sue's live-in girlfriend. A native of Washington, D.C., Simone is a sculptor and ceramist, and is known for her sarcastic quick wit. * Andy Parker: Eric's bisexual, punk-rock musician brother who lives in Columbus. Andy is a stereotypical slacker and player. In 2008, he was recruited by the fictional ex-gay group P.R.E.Y.
