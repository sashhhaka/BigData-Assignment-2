William Cooper of AllMusic highlighted "A Little Bit of Ecstasy" as the album's best track, writing "The sultry vocal, naughty lyrics, and unpredictable tempo changes make "A Little Bit of Ecstasy" a dancefloor classic along the lines of Donna Summer's "Love to Love You Baby". ==Formats and track listings== CD single 12" maxi CD maxi CD maxi - Remixes ==Charts== Chart (1997) Peak Position U.S. Billboard Hot 100 55 U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play 15 U.S. Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales 1 U.S. Rhythmic Top 40 25 ==References== Category:1997 songs Category:1997 singles Category:Jocelyn Enriquez songs Category:House music songs
