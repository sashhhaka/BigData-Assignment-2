Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that it "demonstrates [the] act's versatility and is draped with anthemic drum beats and spacious guitar slides." Steve Morse from Boston Globe felt the group shows some "intoxicating dance rhythms" in songs like "A Better Love".Morse, Steve (28 March 1991). "Record Review" Boston Globe. Pan-European magazine Music & Media stated that here, the band "is once again a display of vocal craftsmanship", describing the song as "up-tempo, yet mildly moody and chartbound." Selina Webb from Music Week said that "this is bound to be two in a row for Anxious's most fruitful signing." She added that "the wholesome harmonies are in fine form and this is easily as strong as 'I've Been Thinking About You'." ==Track listings== * UK 7-inch single # "A Better Love" – 3:59 # "K.I.S.S." – 3:35 * German maxi-CD # "A Better Love" – 3:59 # "She Said She Loves Me" – 4:14 # "K.I.S.S." – 3:35 # "A Better Love" (extended) – 6:25 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1990–1991) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 41 Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) 26 Italy (Musica e dischi) Set "Tipo" on "Singoli".
