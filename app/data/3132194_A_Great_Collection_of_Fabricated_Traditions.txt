Al-Mawdu'at has been described by Al-Nawawi as including many narrations, occupying approximately two volumes.Tadrib Al-Rawi by Al-Suyuti (d.1505), vol. 1, pgs. 471-2, Dar Al-Asimah edition. It consists of some 1847 narrations according to the numbering provided in the latest edition and is currently published in four volumes with ample footnotes providing additional information. ==Criticism== Al-Nawawi (d.1277) criticized the book as containing many hadith which cannot properly be declared mawḍūʻ. Some of them are, according to Al- Suyuti, ḍa‘īf, ḥasan or even ṣaḥīḥ. Ahmad ibn Ali Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d.1449) contends, however, that the majority of the narrations in this book are, in fact, fabricated and that those narrations criticized as not actually being fabricated are very few in comparison. ==References== Category:Sunni hadith collections Category:Hadith Category:Hadith studies Category:Hadith collections Category:12th-century Arabic books
