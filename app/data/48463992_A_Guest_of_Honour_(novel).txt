A Guest of Honour is a 1970 fictional novel by South African writer Nadine Gordimer. Published four years after her novel The Late Bourgeois World, the novel is a political novel that explores the role of revolutionary ideas in new African states. == Critical reception == The New York Times reviewer Thomas Fisk called the novel "a long, spacious, comprehensive work of fiction" which has "something Olympian, something magnificently confident [about how] this South African writer goes about her work." Fisk's review focuses on the stylistic qualities of the novel, calling the characters "exceedingly human: complicated, erring, driven by fleshy appetites and by the loftiest resolves" and discussing the setting as a "landscape so tactile and so sensuous that it becomes a participant in everything that occurs". == References == == Further reading == * * * Category:Novels by Nadine Gordimer Category:20th-century South African novels Category:1970 novels
