A Brand You Can Trust is the debut album from hip hop group La Coka Nostra. It was released on July 14, 2009 on Suburban Noize Records and Uncle Howie Records. The album has become a cult classic amongst fans, selling over 500,000 units and becoming certified gold after only a month, a feat rarely seen in underground hip hop. The album took over three years to make, due to solo projects from Everlast, Slaine, and Ill Bill. It was originally set for release on September 11, 2007 alongside Ill Bill's The Hour of Reprisal album, before both were pushed back. In late 2008 the group, with the help of former Non Phixion DJ DJ Eclipse and Cypress Hill members Sen Dog and DJ Muggs, signed with West Coast punk/hip hop label Suburban Noize Records. The album was recorded and mixed at DJ Lethal's studio and at the Soul Assassins Studio in Los Angeles, California, with additional mixing done in Brooklyn, New York at Ill Bill's in-home studio known as "Cult Leader Media". "Fuck Tony Montana" first appeared on the Ill Bill mixtape Ill Bill Is The Future Vol. 2: I'm a Goon!, released on December 5, 2006. "That's Coke" was remixed for the album due to sample clearance issues of the original version, which used portions from Bobby Byrd's "I'm Not To Blame". == Track listing == # Title Producer(s) Performer (s) 1 "Bloody Sunday" (feat.

Andrew Kameka of HipHopDX wrote that "the album is a mostly solid effort and exactly what someone would expect from a supergroup of like-minded members known for high- energy music". Adam Kennedy of the BBC while praising some the moments of the album said "it’s a tantalising parting taste of potential capabilities, yet until they improve a customer satisfaction hit rate that barely troubles one in three tunes here". Rap Reviews gave it a seven out of ten. Thomas Quinlan of Exclaim! said "La Coka Nostra are an interesting collection of collaborators that live up to the hype". == See also == * House of Pain * Non Phixion * Special Teamz * Limp Bizkit == References == Category:2009 debut albums Category:La Coka Nostra albums Category:Suburban Noize Records albums Category:Albums produced by DJ Lethal Category:Albums produced by the Alchemist (musician)
