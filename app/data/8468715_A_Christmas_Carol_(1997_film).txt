Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide criticized the film for its "barely living up to Saturday morning standards" animation, lack of subtlety as for its morals, its "forgettable" songs, and the inclusion of Debit, making Scrooge's later transformation "less impressive and surprising". Some of the "notable" voice cast members were also noted for their "really poor" work. Daniel W. Kelly of DVD Talk also panned the film's new material put to "attract the attention of children", as well as the animation and the songs, the latter of which were compared with the ones in Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol. Scott G. Mignola of Common Sense Media was also thoroughly critical of the film in his review. ==See also== * List of Christmas films * List of ghost films * Adaptations of A Christmas Carol * List of animated feature-length films ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 direct-to-video films Category:1990s musical drama films Category:American musical drama films Category:1997 animated films Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:1997 fantasy films Category:1997 films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films with screenplays by Jymn Magon Category:20th Century Fox animated films Category:American Christmas films Category:American children's animated fantasy films Category:American direct-to-video films Category:American children's animated musical films Category:DIC Entertainment films Category:20th Century Fox direct-to-video films Category:Animated films based on novels Category:1990s American animated films Category:Animated Christmas films Category:1990s Christmas films Category:1990s musical films Category:1997 drama films Category:1990s children's animated films Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s French films
