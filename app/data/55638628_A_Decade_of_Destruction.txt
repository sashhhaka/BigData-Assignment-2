On October 27, 2017, the band issued "Trouble", the first of two new songs included on the album. ==Background== On October 27, 2017, the website Metal Injection reported that the band's drummer and author Jeremy Spencer had stated to Razor 94.7: "It just seems like it just started even though it's been 10 years. We're always wrapped up in our vacuum in our cocoon of our daily life. So you don't pay attention to that stuff and now we're like 'we have a greatest hits.' And the label thought it was the right time. So we were like 'Cool, let's put some new songs on it though.' We don't wanna make... cause people can pretty much... ya know they have the records already. But now this is a cool package with different stuff on it. The artwork's really rad on it. It's cool." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Ivan Moody – vocals * Zoltan Bathory – rhythm guitars * Jeremy Spencer – drums, percussion * Jason Hook – lead guitars, backing vocals (tracks 1–9, 11–16) * Chris Kael – bass, backing vocals (tracks 1–4, 6–9, 11–15) * Matt Snell – bass, backing vocals (tracks 5, 10, 16) * Darrell Roberts – guitars on "The Bleeding" * Uros Raskovski – guitar solo on "The Bleeding" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2017–18) Peak position New Zealand Heatseeker Albums (RMNZ) 2 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2018) Position US Billboard 200 81 US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) 7 Chart (2019) Position US Billboard 200 171 US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) 24 Chart (2020) Position US Billboard 200 167 US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) 19 Chart (2021) Position US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) 30 ===Singles=== Title Year Peak chart positions US Main.
