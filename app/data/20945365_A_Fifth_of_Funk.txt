A Fifth of Funk is the fifth and final installment of the George Clinton Family Series collection by Parliament-Funkadelic collective members. The album was released in Japan in 1993 by P-Vine Records, and later in the same year by AEM Records in the United States and Sequel Records in the United Kingdom. The compilation's producer and P-Funk leader George Clinton gives his final thoughts about the tracks on the album, as well as his feelings on the entire Family Series project, for A Fifth of Funks final track. The title is a play on words of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, as well as Walter Murphy's 1976 disco hit "A Fifth of Beethoven". ==Track listing== Song credits for A Fifth of Funk adapted from album liner notes.Track listing and credits as per liner notes for A Fifth of Funk album # "Flatman and Bobin" #* Artist: Parliament (1978) Producer: George Clinton #* Drums: Tyrone Lampkin #* Bass: Bootsy Collins #* Keyboards: Bernie Worrell #* Guitars: Garry Shider #* Horns: Horny Horns # "Count Funkula (I Didn't Know That Funk Was Loaded)" #* Artist: Lonnie Greene (1980) Producers: Ron Dunbar, Lonnie Greene #* Drums: Lonnie Greene #* Bass: Donnie Sterling #* Guitars: Tony Thomas # "Thumparella (Oh Kay)" #* Artist: Ron Ford (1981) Producer: Ron Ford # "Eyes of a Dreamer" #* Artist: Jessica Cleaves (1981) Producer: Ron Dunbar # "I Found You" #* Artist: Phillippe Wynne (1981) Producer: Phillippe Wynne, Ron Dunbar #* Background Vocals: Brandie (Telma Hopkins, Joyce Vincent) # "Ice Melting in Your Heart" #* Artist: Brides of Funkenstein (1977) Producer: Ron Dunbar #* Drums: Tyrone Lampkin #* Bass: Junie Morrison #* Guitars: Junie Morrison, Garry Shider #* Keyboards: Bernie Worrell # "Clone Ranger" #* Artist: Trey Lewd's Flastic Brain Flam (1978) #* Producers: Gary Shider, George Clinton #* Drums: Tony Davis #* Bass: Stevie Pannall #* Guitars: Garry Shider, DeWayne McKnight #* Background Vocals: Brides, Parlet # "Who Do You Love" #*Artist: Bernie Worrell (1978) Producers: Bernie Worrell, George Clinton #* Drums: Tyrone Lampkin #* Bass: Rodney 'Skeets' Curtis #* Percussion: Larry Fratangelo #* Keyboards: Bernie Worrell #* Guitars: Gary Shider #"Up Up Up and Away" #*Artist: Brides of Funkenstein (1979) Producer: Ron Dunbar #* Drums: Jerry Jones #* Bass: Rodnick Chandler #* Guitars: Eddie Willis #* Keyboards: Rudi Robinson, Bernie Worrell # "Can't Get Over Losing You" #* Artist: Junie Morrison (1978) Producer: Junie Morrison #* All instruments by Junie Morrison # "Rat Kissed the Cat" #* Artist: George Clinton and Brides of Funkenstein (1977) Producer: George Clinton #* Drums: Tiki Fullwood #* Bass: Billy Bass #* Guitars: Gary Cooper, Garry Shider #* Keyboards: Bernie Worrell #* Horns: Horny Horns # "Too Tight for Light" #* Artist: Funkadelic (1979) Producer: George Clinton, Junie Morrison # "Every Little Bit Hurts" #* Artist: George Clinton, Diane Brooks, & Funkadelic (1972) #* Producer: George Clinton # "Interview - Final Thoughts" #* George Clinton ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * A Fifth of Funk at Discogs Category:George Clinton (funk musician) albums Category:1993 albums Category:P-Vine Records albums
