A Chrestomathy is a retrospective two-CD compilation of songs by Dave Van Ronk released in 1992. Its liner notes explain the title: "CHRES-TO-MA-THY: a selection of choice passages. WHICH MEANS THIS IS A SELECTION OF CHOICE WORKS FROM MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OF DAVE'S MUSIC ON RECORDS." Van Ronk recorded for many record labels. This compilation was released by Gazell Records. ==Reception== Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote of the album "his affection for the pop music of his childhood ("Two Sleepy People," sung with Christine Lavin, "Swinging on a Star"), makes for a more varied chrestomathy than those who think of Dave Van Ronk simply as a folksinger might expect. It's hard to summarize more than three decades in the career of a steadily working musician in less than two hours, even one who recorded in as piecemeal a fashion as this one, but this compilation does a good job." ==Track listing== ===Disc 1=== *Tracks 10-15 originally on The Hudson Dusters ===Disc 2=== *Track 1 originally on Songs for Ageing Children *Tracks 2-4 originally on The Ragtime Jug Stompers *Track 9 originally on Peter and the Wolf *Tracks 10-11 originally on Let No One Deceive You ==References== Category:1990 compilation albums Category:Dave Van Ronk compilation albums
