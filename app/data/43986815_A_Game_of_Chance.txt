A Game of Chance is a 1920 sporting novel by Arthur Wright, about sensational events in the world of Australian horse racing. ==Reception== According to the reviewer in the Western Mail: > Hero and heroine and villain of the piece are well enough drawn; and there > is incident enough in the book to satisfy the veriest glutton for sensation; > while towards the close of an exciting story the murder trial... finishes in > a most unexpected manner. Mr. Arthur Wright has been compared with the late > Nat Gould; and as a rule, his books contain even greater dramatic, or > melodramatic, possibilities, or impossibilities, than the numerous works of > that most prolific writer. ==References== ==External links== *Copy of complete novel at Internet Archive *A Game of Chance at AustLit *A Game of Chance at National Archives of Australia *Serialisation of story in The World's News in 1919 - 22 March, 29 March, 5 April, 12 April, 19 April, 26 April, 3 May, 10 May, 17 May, 24 May, 31 May, 7 June, 14 June, 21 June, 28 June, 5 July Category:1920 Australian novels Category:Australian sports novels Category:Horse racing novels Category:Novels set in Australia
