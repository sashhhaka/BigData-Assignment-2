The album was mixed by engineer Shawn Everett. The album won Best Rock Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. ==Reception== A Deeper Understanding received acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 33 reviews, indicating universal acclaim. According to Marcy Donelson of AllMusic, A Deeper Understanding "reclaims and explores the distinctive soundscapes, vastness, and haunted psyche of Lost in the Dream, and that in itself is significant." On the same site, in a readers' poll by users it was ranked as the #1 album of 2017. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork noted similarities with mid-'80s rock, stating it is "also a fascinating study in influence; it’s hard to think of a band with more obvious touchstones that also sounds so original." Michael Bonner of Uncut Magazine described it as "some of the richest, most compelling and least lonely-sounding music of Granduciel’s career". In a less enthusiastic review for Slant Magazine, Josh Goller noted "the album's lyrics, however, can’t match this same level of musical precision, and Granduciel too often repeats the same vague sentiments using threadbare imagery." The album's title was influenced by Kate Bush's song with the same name. It was nominated for International Album of the Year at the 2018 UK Americana Awards. At the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, A Deeper Understanding won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. ===Accolades=== Publication Accolade Rank Drowned in Sound Favourite Albums of 2017 Exclaim!
