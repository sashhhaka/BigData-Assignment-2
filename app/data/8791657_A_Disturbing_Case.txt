The episode was first broadcast on 28 September 1969 on ITV. It was directed by Ray Austin. ==Synopsis== Jeff Randall initially collapses unconscious after being lightly thrown against a door by Phillip and Pentonville, the two hospital heavies, but later under hypnosis he beats some five men in fights, including Dr. Conrad. Marty is seen pulling objects such as a door towards Jeff's head by inhaling in this episode. When teleporting to a specific location he is also heard to say "Made it! My sense of direction is improving!" In this episode Jeannie's presumably younger sister Jenny is introduced. Like actress Annette Andre who portrays Jeannie she is also real-life Australian, and the likeness between them is similar. Currently unemployed, she's staying with Jeannie from outside London, what she terms "the sticks". ==Cast== *Mike Pratt as Jeff Randall *Kenneth Cope as Marty Hopkirk *Annette Andre as Jeannie Hopkirk *Judith Arthy ....
