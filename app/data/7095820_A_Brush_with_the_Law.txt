"A Brush with the Law" is the eleventh episode of the fifth series of the British comedy series Dad's Army. It was originally transmitted on 15 December 1972. ==Synopsis== Mainwaring is charged with showing a light, contrary to blackout rules, and is taken to court by a cheerful ARP Warden Hodges. As if that was not enough, the magistrate is none other than his old nemesis Captain Square. The Verger tries to warn off Hodges, but Hodges will not back down. The platoon tries to help by testifying as witnesses to Mainwaring's innocence, but things go from bad to worse when Jones messes up his story under oath. As both Square and Hodges proceed to push Mainwaring towards what could be a sticky end, Walker steps in and reveals he was out delivering 'supplies' to a 'nearby customer', putting some pressure on Square by reminding him of his own illegal activities buying blackmarket whisky. Just as Square is about to dismiss the trial, the Verger confesses it was he who showed the light, having used the office after the platoon had left on patrol to write his memoirs, much to the fury of Hodges who has lost his chance to end Mainwaring. The case is dismissed and Mainwaring is allowed to leave the court "without a stain on his character". He attributes his acquittal to "honesty, fair play and the integrity of British justice". ==Cast== *Arthur Lowe as Captain Mainwaring *John Le Mesurier as Sergeant Wilson *Clive Dunn as Lance Corporal Jones *John Laurie as Private Frazer *James Beck as Private Walker *Arnold Ridley as Private Godfrey *Ian Lavender as Private Pike *Bill Pertwee as ARP Warden Hodges *Geoffrey Lumsden as Captain Square *Frank Williams as The Vicar *Edward Sinclair as The Verger *Stuart Sherwin as Junior Warden Reg Adamson *Jeffrey Gardiner as Mr Wintergreen *Marjorie Wilde as Lady Magistrate *Chris Gannon as Mr Bone, the Clerk of the Court *Toby Perkins as Usher ==Notes== #Mainwaring is prosecuted under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, which had been rushed onto the statute book by the government under public pressure.
