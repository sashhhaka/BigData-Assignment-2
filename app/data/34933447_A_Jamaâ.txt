A Jama칙 () is a 2010 film directed by Daoud Aoulad-Syad. It was selected by African Film Festival of Cordoba - FCAT, San Sebasti치n International Film Festival and other international film festivals. == Plot == To make Daoud Aoulad-Syad's previous film, En attendant Pasolini, sets were built on plots rented from those living in the village. A mosque was erected on the plot belonging to Moha, one of the neighbors. When they finished shooting, the film crew left the village. The neighbours demolished all of the sets, except for the mosque, which had become a real place of worship for those who live there. However, this is disastrous for Moha, who used to grow vegetables to feed his family on this land. == Prizes == * Cinemed 2010 * San Sebasti치n 2010 * Tetuan 2011 == References == ==External links== * *San Sebasti치n International Film Festival *Medfilm Festival 2011 Category:2010 films Category:French comedy- drama films Category:Moroccan comedy-drama films Category:2010s French films
