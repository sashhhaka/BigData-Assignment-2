A Joyful Noise is the fifth and final studio album by American indie rock band Gossip, released on May 11, 2012, by Columbia Records. The album was produced by Xenomania founder Brian Higgins. ==Critical reception== A Joyful Noise received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 60, based on 24 reviews, which indicates "mixed or average reviews". Andy Gill of The Independent gave the album four out of five stars, writing that "the involvement of Brian Higgins on A Joyful Noise enables the group to break new ground with confidence". The Guardians Caroline Sullivan gave the album three out of five stars and stated that "it's Girls Aloud producer Higgins to the rescue, with a sound influenced by Abba and Madonna. Having said that, Gossip—especially Beth Ditto, in waspishly fine voice here—seem very much at home with it." However, Priya Elan of NME felt that "[g]ood moments are squandered by unsatisfying choruses and/or weak lyrics." The Independent on Sundays Simon Price expressed that after a few years of career, Ditto "already feels like a footnote", adding that the band pairing up with Higgins "should be a stroke of genius, but Higgins has caught Ditto & co at a point where they appear to have disastrously lost their fire." ==Commercial performance== A Joyful Noise debuted at number 100 on the Billboard 200, selling 5,000 copies in its first week. In Europe, the album debuted at number 47 on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 2,822 copies, while reaching number one in Switzerland, number two in Germany, number three in France, number four in Austria and number eight in Belgium. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of A Joyful Noise. ===Gossip=== * Beth Ditto – vocals * Hannah Blilie – drums, percussion * Nathan Howdeshell – live bass, guitars, keyboards, programming ===Additional musicians=== * Jeremy Sherrer – additional percussion * Brian Higgins – additional programming ; additional composition * Luke Fitton – additional programming * Owen Parker – additional programming * Toby Scott – additional programming ; additional composition * Matt Gray – additional programming * Joshua Jenkin – additional programming * Sam Martin – additional programming * Jerry Bouthier – additional programming * Andrea Gorgerino – additional programming * Fred Falke – additional programming ; additional composition * Jason Resch – additional programming ; additional composition * Kieran Jones – additional programming ; additional composition ===Technical=== * Brian Higgins – production ; mixing * Gossip – additional production * Toby Scott – special production assistance, engineering ; mixing * Jeremy Sherrer – engineering * Ben Taylor – recording engineering assistance * Matt Gray – mixing * Rich Costey – mixing * Chris Kasych – logic engineering * Serban Ghenea – mixing * John Hanes – engineering for mix * Phil Seaford – engineering assistance * Tom Coyne – mastering ===Artwork=== * Rankin – photography * Mike Larremore – additional photography * Jeri Lynn – art direction ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart performance for A Joyful Noise Chart (2012) Peak position Argentine Albums (CAPIF) Note: Define search parameters as "Ranking Semanal Pop" and "20/05/2012". 10 Canadian Albums (Nielsen SoundScan) 87 Greek Albums (IFPI) 39 ===Year-end charts=== Year-end chart performance for A Joyful Noise Chart (2012) Position Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria) 53 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) 59 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) 92 French Albums (SNEP) 62 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) 36 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) 42 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Release dates and formats for A Joyful Noise Region Date Format Edition Label Germany May 11, 2012 Standard Sony Ireland Columbia France May 14, 2012 Sony United Kingdom Columbia Australia May 18, 2012 Sony United States May 22, 2012 Columbia Japan June 13, 2012 CD Sony Germany November 2, 2012 Extended ==References== Category:2012 albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Gossip (band) albums
