A Fire Inside EP is an extended play by American rock band AFI. It was released on September 29, 1998, through Adeline Records. The EP is titled after the band's full moniker, first revealed with their previous album, Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes. The release includes two original songs and two covers. It is the first release to mention Hunter Burgan as a permanent member, and the last to feature founding guitarist Mark Stopholese. The font on the cover is similar to one frequently used by Alkaline Trio. Behind the CD tray is the message "Nothing can erase the damage done". In November 2010, Adeline Records released a special-edition pressing on purple vinyl, limited to 500 copies. == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from liner notes. * AFI – producer * Joe Brook – band photos * Hunter Burgan – bass * Adam Carson – drums * Andy Earnst – recording, mixing * Tedd Francis – lyric art * Davey Havok – vocals * John Joh – re-design * Markus Stopholese – guitar * Luke Ogden – fire photo * Jamie Reilly – layout * Jim Thiebaud – layout ;Studios * Recorded at The Art of Ears, Hayward, CA * Mastered at Oceanview Digital Mastering, LA, CA ==References== Category:1998 EPs Category:AFI (band) EPs Category:Adeline Records EPs
