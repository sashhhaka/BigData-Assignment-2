Latvian Culture Canon It is shown every year on TV prior to the summer solstice festival of Jāņi, which is a national holiday in Latvia. The movie is about the struggle of two related families for the eighty-year-old aunt's inheritance through comic and romantic events. == Plot == The movie begins when old auntie Mirta (Mirta Saknīte) succeeds in a lottery and wins a car which every Soviet citizen longs for – a Zhiguli car. Because of her old age, she cannot use the car herself. And when the word spreads out about her luck, different family members all of a sudden come to her countryside house to 'be helpful' in favour to get the car after aunt's death. Mirta's nephew Ēriks with his wife Dagnija and their son Uģis decided to give up their holiday to Carpathian Mountains just to lay their hands on aunties' legacy. Not only Mirta's nephew decided to surprise her with his arrival but her ex-daughter- in-law Olita together with her new family including her new husband Viktors and their offspring Lāsma. The funny rivalry between two sides of the family, foolish jealousy of the near living peasants' family, who had always non- selfishly been there for auntie Mirta, is a caricature of greasy human nature. This is a slight humor of the Soviet life details as well. But aunt Mirta isn't a fool, she is still young in her heart until her very last breath, which also can be seen in her last will - to whom she left her car to, a Limousine The Colour Of Midsummer's Eve. ==Family members== *Aunt Mirta (Mirta Saknīte) — Lilita Bērziņa === Tūteri family === *Dagnija — Olga Dreģe *Ēriks — Uldis Dumpis *Uģis — Gundars Āboliņš === Sprēsliņi family === *Olita — Baiba Indriksone *Viktors — Boļeslavs Ružs *Lāsma — Diāna Zande == Awards == A Limousine the Colour of Midsummer's Eve in 1981 was named as the best full- length movie that year by Latvian National Movie Festival "Lielais Kristaps".
