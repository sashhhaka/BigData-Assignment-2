There is one woman whose beauty is such that (in theory) a man would come back if promised her hand in marriage. So a man is sent to look over the mountain. === Blagdaross === "On a waste place strewn with bricks in the outskirts of a town," several objects (an old cork, an unstruck match, a broken kettle, a piece of cord/rope, and an old rocking-horse) tell their life stories. === The Madness of Andelsprutz === A tale in which a man visits a city and engages in conversation with two men as to whether or not the city of Andelsprutz is dead or was never alive then one of the men tells a tale of the city and how all cities have souls; he knows because he saw Andelsprutz's soul and engaged in a conversation with her. === Where the Tides Ebb and Flow === A story from the perspective of a dead body and what it experiences. === Bethmoora === A narrator tells the background of the desolate and abandoned city of Bethmoora. The city was abandoned abruptly for mysterious reasons, possibly a warning from the gods, a message from an emperor, disease or the desert. Bethmoora is brought up again in the later story, The Hashish Man. === Idle Days on the Yann === The narrator takes a river voyage down the Yann on the ship Bird of the River. The ship stops at Mandaroon, where the citizens sleep to prevent the gods from dying and dreaming to end; Astahahn, where citizens use ancient rituals to prevent Time from slaying the gods; Perd√≥ndaris, a great trading city; and Nen, the last city on the river. The ship finally reaches the Gate of Yann: two narrow, mountain-high, smooth and pink marble cliffs that the river flows between into the sea. Departing, the protagonist knows he will not meet the captain again, because his fancy is growing weaker. === The Sword and the Idol === A tale of early humans. Loz invents an iron sword and comes to rule the tribe. Generations later, when Loz's descendant Lod is chief, Ird introduces religion to the tribe in the form of the worship of Ged. A battle of wills between Lod and Ird ends with Lod giving the sword to Ird. === The Idle City === Four short short stories told to gain entry to the Idle City. === The Hashish Man === The narrator of "Bethmoora" meets a man at a party who has visited the city more recently with the aid of hashish. He tells the narrator the city was abandoned at the order of emperor Thuba Mleen of Utnar Vehi. He describes some of the horrors of Thuba Mleen before fleeing the party to stay ahead of the police. === Poor Old Bill === A tale of a terrible pirate captain, whose crew maroon him. Unfortunately, while he lives his curses still have magical power, and prevent them from entering any harbor. === The Beggars === A daydream of cheerful beggars in lordly cloaks, who find cheer and fortune in everything. === Carcassonne === After a prophecy given to a king that he will never set foot in the city of Carcassonne, the heroes of the court vow to conquer the city, the location of which is unknown. === In Zaccarath === The king of Zacarath calls for prophecies. The prophets foretell doom, but the king and all of his court hear only tales that tell of everlasting Zacarath. At the end the narrator finds a rock that may once have been part of the marvellous palace of Zacarath. === The Field === The narrator finds a field of flowers that seems to have a malevolence about it. He questions a poet, who informs him it is a battlefield. === The Day of the Poll === A poet kidnaps a voter on election day, and tries to get him to see the beauty and glamour in the world. === The Unhappy Body === A story about a body forced to work for a living, while the soul strives for poetry. ==Sources== * ==External links== * * Category:1910 short story collections Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:Short story collections by Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany
