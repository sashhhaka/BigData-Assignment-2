A Different Hat is the thirteenth solo studio album by the English singer- songwriter Paul Carrack. Recorded with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, it is a collection mostly of cover songs, ranging from the Frank Sinatra standard "All the Way" to the Bonnie Raitt ballad "I Can't Make You Love Me". Carrack also tackled four of his own songs which he had previously recorded, heard here in new arrangements: "I Live On a Battlefield" (previously recorded as "Battlefield" on 1989's Groove Approved), "Eyes of Blue", "Love Will Keep Us Alive" and "It Ain't Over". A Different Hat was originally released in 2010 on Carrack's own Carrack-UK label. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Musicians * Paul Carrack – vocals, grand piano * The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra – orchestra * David Cullen – orchestral arrangements and conductor * Gill Townend – music preparation * Davy Spillane – low whistle Production * Peter Van Hooke – producer * Paul Carrack – producer * Geoff Foster – engineer * Simon Rhodes – engineer * Graham Bonnett – additional engineer * Rupert Cobb – additional engineer, Pro Tools * Mick Glossop – mixing * Ian Ross – design * Andrea Hunnisett – photography ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010 albums Category:Paul Carrack albums Category:Royal Philharmonic Orchestra albums
