A Fistful of...4-Skins is the second studio album by English punk rock/Oi! band, The 4-Skins, released in 1983 by Syndicate Records. In comparison to The 4-Skins' previous material, "A Fistful Of...4-Skins" featured a slower, heavier, more melodic, hard rock-based sound. Less successful than its predecessor, the album charted outside the Top 30 on the UK independent chart. The band members claimed that this was due to chart manipulation. The album was later combined with debut LP, The Good, The Bad & The 4-Skins (omitting the track "One Law for Them" from that album due to space limitations) and released on a single CD by Link Records in 1987 as A Few 4-Skins More, Vol.1. Following the breakup of the line-up that recorded the band's previous album, The Good, The Bad & The 4-Skins, Hoxton Tom McCourt had assembled a new line- up (the fourth overall) including former The Last Resort singer Roi Pearce, and future Skrewdriver guitarist, Paul Swain. ==Track listing== Source: Amazon ==Personnel== *Roi Pearce – lead vocals *Hoxton Tom McCourt – bass guitar, lead vocal on "New War" *Ian Bransom – drums *Paul Swain – guitar *Keith Bollock Brother – backing vocals *Neil Barker – backing vocals ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:The 4-Skins albums
