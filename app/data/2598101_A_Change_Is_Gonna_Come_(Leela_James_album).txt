A Change Is Gonna Come is the debut album by American soul singerâ€“songwriter Leela James. It was released on Warner Bros. Records on June 21, 2005 in the United States. ==Overview== James covers Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" and No Doubt's "Don't Speak" on the album. ==Critical reception== Allmusic editor Andy Kellman wrote that the album "retains a nostalgic tint. James has the stature of a woman who should possess a squeaky voice, but she sings with demonstrative grit. More importantly, she doesn't see her inspirations merely as artists to mimic; she sees how they learned from the past and applied it to the present. The past is built upon (if only a little), rather than simply revisited [...] There's plenty of thematic range, whether there are blue lights in the basement, tears on the pillow, sweat on the dancefloor, or sun showers on the porch." ==Track listing== Credits adapted from the liner notes of A Change Is Gonna Come.
