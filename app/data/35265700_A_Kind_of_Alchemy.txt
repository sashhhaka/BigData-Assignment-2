A Kind of Alchemy is the second studio album from the alternative/progressive rock band byron. Released on 23 October 2009 at The Silver Church Club in Bucharest. It contains two singles, "Diggin' a Hole" and "King Of Clowns". ==Music== A Kind Of Alchemy contains blues, progressive and funk influences. Dan Byron said that "the mood is nocturnal, rather intimate, sometimes playful or even exuberant", and the album as a whole deals with the "process of creation, ranging from madness to zen". One part of the album has an extra sensitivity, another part is more aggressive, with a clear rhythm section. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;byron *Dan Byron – vocals, acoustic guitar, flute, melodica *Costin Oprea – electric guitar *Cristi Mateşan – drums *6fingers – keyboards, backing vocals, rhodes, accordion *Vladimir Săteanu - bass ;Additional musicians *René Popescu - violin *Ana Ghiţă - violin *Alexandra Toader - viola *Alexandru Gorneanu - cello *Petre Ionuţescu - trumpet *Jane D. - backing vocals on "A Little Bit Deranged" *Lu Cozma - backing vocals on "War" ;Production *Produced by byron and A&A; Records *Mixed and mastered by Victor Panfilov at Real Sound & Vision ==References== Category:Byron (band) albums Category:2009 albums
