A Book of Milliganimals is a children's book by Spike Milligan, first published in 1968. The book has three parts; the first two, Animals and Milliganimals, contain humorous poetry and illustrations by Milligan of animals, both real and imaginary. The third part, entitled The Bald Twit Lion, is a surreal, comedic story of a lion who loses his mane and his struggle to re-grow it and overcome his embarrassment. His mane is eventually restored by God, who slides down to Earth from Heaven on a religious giraffe's neck. ==References== * Category:1968 children's books Category:Works by Spike Milligan
