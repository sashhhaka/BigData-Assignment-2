"A Deeper Love" is a song written by American producers Robert Clivillés and David Cole, and performed by them as Clivillés & Cole featuring vocals by Deborah Cooper and Paul Pesco. The song was the duo's fifth number-one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. On other US charts, "A Deeper Love" peaked at number 83 on the soul singles chart and number 44 on the pop chart. Overseas, especially in Europe the single charted higher, going to number 15 in the UK and number eight on the Dutch Top 40. Originally, Clivilles & Cole released an LP-single A-side that had their version of U2's "Pride (In the Name of Love)" which peaked at number six on the US dance chart as well as peaking at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Critical reception== Clark and DeVaney from Cash Box wrote, "This single is your basic "house, club- styled" cut that will easily find its way into the club scene after the buzz starts. The "Radio Edit Remix" has a lot more sounds in it, and would be preferred for radio play." Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented, that here, C&C; Music Factory "do what the Pet Shop Boys ("Where The Streets Have No Name") did before them—adapt a song of world's leading rock band U2 and take it to the dance floor. The gospel-framed arrangement makes their version particularly interesting." Andy Beevers from Music Week said that "just when "Pride" has dropped from the charts, its B-side (which was the track most DJs were playing anyway) re-appears as a single in its own right. The brand new 12 minute long Deeper Feeling remix, executed by C&C; themselves. is even more anthemic than the original and is strong enough to take the song back into the Top 40. Well, it worked for "Black And White"." Jonathan Bernstein from Spin wrote, "Criminally, Clivilles & Cole's epic "A Deeper Love" saw little chart action. No other record this year delivered as phenomenally in terms of dynamic performance. In this instance, the public failed." In 2004, Slant Magazine ranked the song number five in their list of "The 100 Greatest Dance Songs of All Time". In 2020, the magazine placed it at number 16 in their list of "The 100 Best Dance Songs of All Time". ==Music video== The music video for these songs was actually one long featurette, beginning with "Deeper Love" and then continuing into "Pride (In The Name Of Love)" halfway through the video. The video was labelled "Pride (A Deeper Love)". ==Track listing== ==Charts== Weekly chart performance for "A Deeper Love" Chart (1992) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 85 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 42 Europe (European Dance Radio) 4 Finland (IFPI) 3 Spain (AFYVE) 9 UK Dance (Music Week) 2 US Hot Dance Club Play (Billboard) 1 ==Aretha Franklin version== In 1994, American singer and songwriter Aretha Franklin covered "A Deeper Love" featuring a backing vocal by Lisa Fischer; this version was also produced by Clivillés & Cole and was later released on January 31, 1994, by Arista Records as the lead single of her Greatest Hits (1980–1994) collection. The Aretha Franklin version also went to number one on the US dance charts for two weeks. On other US charts, "A Deeper Love" went to number 30 on the soul singles chart and number 63 on the Hot 100 as well as being featured in a special remix played over the end credits to Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award in the category for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance, but lost to "Breathe Again" by Toni Braxton. ===Critical reception=== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that the massive 1992 club hit for Clivillés & Cole "gets a dynamic, melodramatic reading from the Queen of Soul", describing it as "gospel-soaked" and stating further that the album version "sticks fairly close in style to the original record, with myriad remixes traveling down a variety of more current, trend-conscious roads. C & C deliver an abundance of slammin' sounds that are over-the-top enough to keep up with La Franklin's vocal." Alexis Petridis from The Guardian deemed it a "great excursion into house music", noting that "picking up on the religious undercurrent of the lyrics, she shifts from scat singing to fervent gospel sermonising". Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented, "What would good old Jerry Wexler think of this? The Queen of the Atlantic soul now offers her services to C&C;'s dance hit factory." NOS/Hilversum DJ/producer Tom Blomberg was continually struck by Franklin's "incredible gospel-esque" vocals. He said, "That dance groove is still very acceptable for radio. Besides, it's no longer 1967, technique has developed since then, so why wouldn't she benefit from that?" Andy Beevers from Music Week rated the song five out of five, stating that it "manages to be even more uplifting" than the 1992 original, and "has all the hallmarks of a big hit." Karen Holmes from The Network Forty felt that here, the singer "waves her magical wand again with a brilliant rendition that transcends any format restrictions. Taking the best of what we remember her for, then adding a little more spice than in recent projects, this track targets all demos." Tony Cross from Smash Hits gave Franklin's version three out of five, writing that "the grandmother of soul has belted it out big style. It's just what you'd expect, a real soul sisters' smash with gospel girls that have thrown away their hymn sheets for something fun and funky. Go for it, grandma." ===Impact and legacy=== "A Deeper Love" was awarded one of ASCAP's Rhythm & Soul Awards in 1995. Fact ranked the song number five in their list of "21 Diva-House Belters That Still Sound Incredible" in 2014. Billboard ranked it number 42 in their list of "Best LGBTQ Anthems of All Time" in 2022. ===Accolades=== |- |1995 || "A Deeper Love" || Grammy Award for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance || |- ===Track listings=== ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== Weekly chart performance for "A Deeper Love" Chart (1994) Peak position Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) 15 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 12 Europe (European Dance Radio) 2 Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) 12 France (SNEP) 34 Germany (Official German Charts) 78 Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) 13 Ireland (IRMA) 30 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 31 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 34 Scotland (OCC) 24 Spain (AFYVE) 7 UK Singles (OCC) 5 UK Dance (Music Week) 1 UK Club Chart (Music Week) 1 US Hot Dance Club Play (Billboard) 1 US Cash Box Top 100 56 ====Year-end charts==== Year-end chart performance for "A Deeper Love" Chart (1994) Position UK Singles (OCC) 100 UK Club Chart (Music Week) 25 US Hot Dance Music Club/Play (Billboard) 4 == What Can We Do (A Deeper Love) == "What Can We Do (A Deeper Love)" is a song by Dutch disc jockey and producer Tiësto with uncredited vocals from American singer Anastacia.
