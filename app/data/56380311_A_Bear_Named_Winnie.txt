Milne's Winnie The Pooh. ==Plot== At the outbreak of World War 1, troops march through the Manitoban city of Winnipeg. Among them is Lieutenant Harry Colebourn (Fassbender), a veteran with a gift for animals. He soon meets a bear, Winnie, who provides comfort for the soldiers and by order of General Hallholland (David Suchet), becomes the regimental mascot. == Cast == ==Copyright== To avoid legal problems concerning the copyrights of both Disney and the Milne estate, Winnie the Pooh and anything related to the property is never referenced nor discussed throughout the film. ==Critical response== John Ferguson of The Radio Times awarded it two stars and said, "This touching fact-based drama almost manages to carry off its combination of First World War setting and sentimental tale, but is unsure of its target audience." == See also == *Goodbye Christopher Robin - a 2017 biographical drama film about Milne and his son, with Vaughan also acting as a writer and producer. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * A Bear Named Winnie at the Internet Movie Database * A Bear Named Winnie at Rotten Tomatoes Category:2004 films Category:2004 television films Category:2004 biographical drama films Category:Canadian war drama films Category:English-language Canadian films Category:World War I films based on actual events Category:Films set in 1914 Category:Films about bears Category:Films directed by John Kent Harrison Category:2004 drama films Category:Winnie-the-Pooh films Category:2000s English-language films Category:Canadian World War I films Category:2000s Canadian films
