A Day in Summer is the first novel by J. L. Carr, published in 1963. It is the story of an RAF veteran named Peplow who arrives in the fictional village of Great Minden on the day of its annual Feast (or fair), seeking retribution for the death of his son. Carr started the novel as a part of written work for classes of the Workers' Educational Association and described it as his most technically ambitious novel, so it was "foolhardy to start with".Carr, J.L.
