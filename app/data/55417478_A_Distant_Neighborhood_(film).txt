A Distant Neighborhood () is a 2010 internationally co-produced fantasy film directed by Sam Garbarski. The screenplay, written by Garbarski alongside Jérôme Tonnerre and Philippe Blasband, was based on the manga of the same name by Jiro Taniguchi. The film stars Pascal Greggory, Jonathan Zaccaï, Alexandra Maria Lara and Léo Legrand, with Évelyne Didi, Lionel Abelanski and Tania Garbarski in supporting roles. The film tells the story of Thomas Verniaz, a middle-aged family man who accidentally takes a train ride back to his old hometown and visits his mother's grave. Thomas is then transported back in time, and discovers that he's a teenager again, but with all of his adult memories intact. A Distant Neighborhood was met with mostly positive reviews, with critics commending its faithfulness to the source material and the performances of its cast, particularly Zaccaï and Legrand. It received five nominations at the 2011 Magritte Awards, including Best Director for Garbarski, and went on to win Best Production Design for Véronique Sacrez. == Cast == * Pascal Greggory as Thomas Verniaz * Jonathan Zaccaï as Bruno Verniaz * Alexandra Maria Lara as Anna Verniaz (née Zorn) * Léo Legrand as young Thomas Verniaz * Évelyne Didi as Yvette * Lionel Abelanski as Godin * as Catherine * Tania Garbarski as Nelly ==Accolades== Award / Film Festival Category Recipients and nominees Result Festival du Film Francophone Views of the Present Sam Garbarski Magritte Award Best Director Sam Garbarski Best Actor Jonathan Zaccaï Best Supporting Actress Tania Garbarski Best Production Design Véronique Sacrez Best Costume Design Claire Dubien Rome Film Festival Alice in the City Prize Transatlantyk Festival Audience Award Young Artist Award Best Young Performer Léo Legrand == References == == External links == * Category:2010 films Category:2010 fantasy films Category:Belgian fantasy films Category:Films about time travel Category:Films shot in France Category:Films shot in Luxembourg Category:French fantasy films Category:2010s French- language films Category:German fantasy films Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Luxembourgian fantasy films Category:French-language Luxembourgian films Category:2010s French films Category:2010s German films
