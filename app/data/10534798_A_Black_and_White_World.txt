A Black and White World is a 2005 Australian short film. It is the story of a character in a black-and-white silent film, who transcends the medium and in doing so changes with it. Written and directed by Adam White, the story pays homage to the era of film when silent pictures were being superseded by talkies. On a more simple level, it is a love story about the possibilities of change. The film was shot on Super16 in studios and locations in Melbourne during September and October 2004. Since screening to cast and crew at the Capitol Theatre, Melbourne in March 2005, A Black and White World has been selected to screen at various international film festivals including the Brisbane International Film Festival (Australia), the Telluride Film Festival (US), the Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films (US), the Manhattan Short Film Festival (US), the Calgary Film Festival (Canada), the Cardiff Film Festival (Wales), and Flickerfest (Australia). In 2006 the film was screened at the US Comedy Arts Festival (US) and the Boulder International Film Festival (US). ==Synopsis== A Black and White World is the story of Johnny (Scott Brennan â€“ skitHOUSE), a character on a quest to win back the heart of Mary (Isabella Dunwill), his estranged girlfriend - Adam White based the story on his relationship with his ex-girlfriend.
