Its author, Hotten, included histories of some slangs (back slang and rhyming slang), a detailed bibliography, and a noted definition: : Slang represents that evanescent, vulgar language, ever changing with fashion and taste, … spoken by persons in every grade of life, rich and poor, honest and dishonest … Slang is indulged in from a desire to appear familiar with life, gaiety, town-humour and with the transient nick names and street jokes of the day … Slang is the language of street humour, of fast, high and low life … Slang is as old as speech and the congregating together of people in cities. It is the result of crowding, and excitement, and artificial life. It is often full of the most pungent satire, and is always to the point. Without point Slang has no raison d’etre.Quoted by Jonathon Green, in Toby Ash, 2012. Hotten's work was arguably the most important work on swears since Francis Grose's 1785 Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue.Tony Thorne (2000) "Slang and the Dictionary". ==Editions== * 1859 – First edition, originally published as by "A London Antiquary" * 1860 – Second edition * 1864 – Related text: Illustrations of Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words * 1865 – Third edition * 1872 – Fourth edition * 1874 – Fifth edition ==Notes== ==References and further research== * Julie Coleman, A History of Cant and Slang Dictionaries, Volume III: 1859-1936.
