A Christmas Carol (a.k.a. A Christmas Carol: Scrooge's Ghostly Tale) is a 2006 British-German computer-animated Christmas film. It is an adaptation of the 1843 Charles Dickens novella of the same name, and was produced by BKN International and BKN New Media, and was the first release in BKN's "BKN Classic Series" anthology of computer-animated direct-to-video films. The film was first released in the United States theatrically in select cities by Kidtoon Films on November 6, 2006. It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on November 20, 2006 by BKN Home Entertainment, and a day later in the United States on November 21, 2006, by Genius Products. This version casts the famous Dickens characters as anthropomorphic animals; Ebenezer Scrooge and his relatives are skunks, Bob Cratchit and his family are rabbits, the ghost of Jacob Marley is a cricket, the Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are a stork, kangaroo, and walrus. This version differs from the original novella in many ways; for example, the Ghost of Christmas Future actually speaks, while in most versions he remains silent. Tiny Tim does not die in the possible future revealed to Scrooge, but instead becomes as miserly as he is.Jacob Marley is said to be have been dead for two years, unlike the original in which he was dead for seven years, Scrooge's death is also different, as he drowned due to his own greed by stacking his gold until it fell on him rather than dying of natural causes and joins Marley in the afterlife. Scrooge's childhood home is also shown. ==Cast== *Timothy Bentinck as Narrator and Ebenezer Scrooge *Jo Wyatt as Mrs. Cratchit *Brian Bowles as Bob Cratchit *Keith Wickham as Collector for the Orphanage #1, Scrooge's Father, The Ghosts of Christmas Present and Future and Jacob Marley *Teresa Gallagher as Ghost of Christmas Past, Tiny Tim and Fan *Adam Rhys Dee as Fred *Alan Marriott as Collector for the Orphanage #2 (uncredited) ==See also== * List of Christmas films * List of ghost films * List of American films of 2006 * Adaptations of A Christmas Carol * List of animated feature-length films ==References== ==External links== * * A Christmas Carol at Big Cartoon Database Category:2006 films Category:2006 computer-animated films Category:Animated films based on novels Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:British Christmas films Category:British children's films Category:British computer-animated films Category:2000s American animated films Category:2000s Christmas films Category:2000s children's animated films Category:2006 direct-to-video films Category:Films produced by Rick Ungar Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s British films
