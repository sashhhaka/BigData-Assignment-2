Ett farligt frieri, or A dangerous proposal, aka A dangerous wooing is the first silent film directed by Swedish director Rune Carlsten in 1919. The film has been the subject of a restoration in 2010 with intertitles in Swedish and English by the Swedish Film Institute. ==Synopsis== In a small village in the Swedish mountains, all the boys are in love with Aslaugh, the daughter of rich farmer Knut Husaby. Thormund, the wealthiest farmer in the village proposes to marry his son Ola to Aslaug. Husaby is in favour of this marriage but asks his daughter whether she agrees. Aslaug refuses because she is in love with Tore Naesset, a small-holder's son. Her father is violently opposed to such a wedding and sends her to his summer farm, high in the mountains, hoping she'll change her mind. Tore manages to join Aslaug at the summer farm but on his way back on the only available road which passes by Husaby farm, he gets a hard beating from Huseby who lets him go with an ironic promise: "If next Saturday you manage to slip past the Husaby wolf and his cubs, the girl will be yours". The following week, Tore tries to sneak past the farm without success. He then decides to climb the steep cliff which borders the summer farm on the river side. After nearly falling, he manages to reach the top, exhausted. Husaby, impressed by his courage, agrees to let him marry Aslaug.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: ==Cast== thumb|280px|right|Lars Hanson and Gull Cronvall *Lars Hanson - Tore Næsset * Gull Cronvall - Aslaug * Theodor Blick - Knut Husaby, Aslaug's father * Hjalmar Peters - Thormund, rich farmer * Kurt Welin - Ola, Thormund's son * Hugo Tranberg - Sigurd Husaby *Gösta Cederlund - Eyvind Husaby * Hilda Castegren - Tore's mother *Torsten Bergström - fiddler ==Production== The film was based on Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's novella A dangerous courtship, published in 1856.
