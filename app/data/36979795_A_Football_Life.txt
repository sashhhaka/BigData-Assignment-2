A Football Life is an American documentary series of 116 episodes, developed by NFL Films and aired on NFL Network that documents the lives of select National Football League (NFL) players, coaches, owners, and teams. Friends, teammates, family members and other players and coaches associated with the subjects are interviewed. ==History== The name of the series originated in a quote from Steve Sabol of NFL Films: Originating as an NFL Network special on the career of Bill Parcells in November 2010, it premiered as an episodic series on September 15, 2011, with the first part of Bill Belichick's documentary. Unlike most episodes, the episode on Belichick was a two-hour documentary, and focused specifically on the 2009 season; Belichick agreed to be wired for sound for the entire season. The documentary was viewed by about 657,000 viewers, the most-watched documentary in NFL Network's history, and was the second-most watched program in Boston at the time with 151,000 viewers, trailing behind a Boston Red Sox game. Season Two began on September 12, 2012, with The Faces of Tebow. The series was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Edited Sports Series/Anthology" and "Outstanding Promotional Announcement â€“ Episodic" for Belichick's episode in 2012. Season One was eventually released on DVD. ==Episodes== ===Season One=== Source: No. Subject Original air date 1 Bill Belichick September 15, 2011 2 September 22, 2011 3 Reggie White & Jerome Brown September 29, 2011 4 Kurt Warner October 6, 2011 5 Walter Payton October 13, 2011 6 Ed Sabol October 20, 2011 7 Mike Ditka October 27, 2011 8 Tom Landry November 3, 2011 9 Al Davis November 11, 2011 ===Season Two=== Source: No. Subject Original air date 1 Tim Tebow September 12, 2012 2 Ray Lewis September 19, 2012 3 Tom Coughlin September 26, 2012 4 Cleveland '95 October 3, 2012 5 The Fearsome Foursome October 10, 2012 6 Steve McNair October 17, 2012 7 Eddie DeBartolo October 24, 2012 8 Chris Spielman October 31, 2012 9 Jimmy Johnson November 7, 2012 10 John Riggins November 21, 2012 11 Barry Sanders December 5, 2012 12 Marcus Allen December 12, 2012 13 The Immaculate Reception December 19, 2012 ===Season Three=== Source: No. Subject Original air date 1 LaDainian Tomlinson September 3, 2013 2 Don Shula September 10, 2013 3 Darrelle Revis September 17, 2013 4 Derrick Thomas September 24, 2013 5 Steve Sabol October 1, 2013 6 Matt Millen October 8, 2013 7 Michael Strahan October 15, 2013 8 Pat Summerall October 22, 2013 9 Warren Sapp October 29, 2013 10 Randall Cunningham November 5, 2013 11 Cris Carter November 12, 2013 12 The Forward Pass November 19, 2013 13 Steve Gleason November 26, 2013 14 The Great Wall of Dallas December 3, 2013 15 Houston '93 December 10, 2013 16 Marty Schottenheimer December 17, 2013 17 Vince Lombardi December 24, 2013 18 December 31, 2013 19 Tiki & Ronde Barber January 7, 2014 20 Bill Parcells January 14, 2014 21 Jerry Smith January 21, 2014 22 Jerry Rice January 28, 2014 ===Season Four=== Season Four was announced for September 10, 2014.
