The documentary shows the dancers and the phenomenon expanding beyond the bailes, slums and DJs. ==See also== *Battle of the year ==References== Category:2012 films Category:2010s Portuguese-language films Category:Brazilian documentary films Category:Documentary films about dance Category:Films shot in Rio de Janeiro (city)
