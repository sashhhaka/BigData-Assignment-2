A Bigger Splash is a 1973 British biographical documentary film about David Hockney's lingering breakup with his then-partner Peter Schlesinger, from 1970 to 1973. Directed by Jack Hazan and edited by David Mingay, it has music by Patrick Gowers. Featuring many of Hockney's circle, it includes designers Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark, artist Patrick Procktor, gallery owner John Kasmin and museum curator Henry Geldzahler. == Analysis == It is a fly-on-the- wall documentary, intercut with fictionalised and fantasy elements. It was a groundbreaking production at the time and remains notable for its treatment of gay themes and its insights into Hockney's life and work. The film takes its title from the 1967 painting A Bigger Splash, perhaps Hockney's best-known Californian swimming pool picture and his best-known artwork at all. Hockney was initially shocked by its intimacy but later changed his mind. == Critical reception and legacy== A Bigger Splash was a critical and commercial success upon its release. It was praised for its honesty, insight, and originality. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Documentary Film in 1974. It is considered a landmark film in the history of documentary filmmaking. It was one of the first films to explore gay themes in a frank and open way, and it helped to break down the stigma surrounding homosexuality. The film is also notable for its innovative use of documentary techniques, such as the use of fictionalised and fantasy elements. A Bigger Splash has been praised by filmmakers and critics alike. Martin Scorsese called it "a masterpiece" and "one of the most important films ever made about the creative process." The film has also been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Gus Van Sant and Todd Haynes. == Home Video == A Bigger Splash was released on DVD and Blu- ray by Criterion. ==See also== * Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), 1972 Hockney painting featured in the film. == References == ==External links== * * Category:1974 films Category:1974 documentary films Category:1970s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1970s biographical films Category:1973 LGBT-related films Category:1973 films Category:British avant-garde and experimental films Category:British biographical films Category:David Hockney Category:Documentary films about gay men Category:Documentary films about painters Category:1970s English-language films Category:1970s British films Category:British LGBT-related documentary films
