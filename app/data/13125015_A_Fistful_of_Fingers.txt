The film was never commercially available on home video in either country, although Wright said in 2015 that he hoped to "finally release it [...] with a commentary and everything". ===Reception=== Derek Elley of Variety said the film showed, "more wit and invention than most of its no-budget Brit saddlemates." Time Out said, "Wright may not be in the class of Robert Rodriguez, but he has talent", and said the film was, "Best seen after a couple of beers." Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com called it, "...delightfully dorky, irreverent and scrappy, the exact kind of project a young filmmaker would make if they just wanted to make fellow nerds laugh and were pretty good at doing so." Ethan Anderton of SlashFilm said, "What makes [the film] so delightful is that it's a spaghetti western send-up that respects the genre as much as it makes fun of it." Stark of Pornokitsch said, "As a Western, it's good fun, and as a debut, it's a hell of an effort." Ramsey Ess of Vulture said, "While [the film is] missing many of the trademark editorial flourishes and camera tricks that would be adopted by the time Shaun of the Dead came around, it's still a well-constructed, quickly paced piece of work." ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1995 films Category:British parody films Category:Films directed by Edgar Wright Category:Films with screenplays by Edgar Wright Category:1990s parody films Category:British Western (genre) comedy films Category:1990s Western (genre) comedy films Category:Western (genre) film remakes Category:1995 directorial debut films Category:1995 comedy films Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s British films
