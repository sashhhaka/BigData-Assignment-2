Drifting from place to place, Chance finds himself in his hometown at Christmas time. However, his son (still resenting the fact that Chance ran out on his family 25 years earlier), gives Chance only one day with his grandkids; after that, he's expected to leave and never come back. Meanwhile, Chance's friends warn him that his son and the past are memories that are best left alone, and should leave, but he has to find out for himself. ==Cast== * Barnard Hughes as Chance * Gerald McRaney as Charlie * Wendy Crewson as Laurie * William Hickey as Cincinnati Harold * Harley Cross as Bobby Grovner * Helen Stenborg as Mrs. Gladys Morgan * Michael Flynn as Priest * Lee Weaver as Biloxi Slim * Jamie Sorrentini as Kathy Grovner * Michael Rudd as Omaha John Boswell * Logan Field as Lt.
