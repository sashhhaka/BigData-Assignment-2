A Different Light is the second album by Sherwood, and it continues the band's musical style. The album contains several re-recorded versions of tracks off their Summer EP (2006), as well as new tracks that help the band drift into new musical territory. It is the first album since the band signed with MySpace Records, and was preceded by several 'Making of' videos available on the band's MySpace page. The song "The Best in Me" was used as the opening song for MTV's show College Life. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2007 albums Category:Sherwood (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Lou Giordano
