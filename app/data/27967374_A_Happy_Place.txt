The constant movement of the lift and oneâ€™s inability to stop it represent the constant flow of life. The hat Melua wears in the video was made by a milliner called Piers Atkinson. In an interview with The Sun, Melua explained with regards to the video: "It was about finding peace within yourself no matter how much life is flowing in the right or wrong direction." ==Track listing== ;Digital download ;CD single ==Release history== Region Date Format Label United Kingdom 12 July 2010 Airplay Dramatico 23 July 2010 Digital download 26 July 2010 CD single Germany 3 August 2010amazon.de.
