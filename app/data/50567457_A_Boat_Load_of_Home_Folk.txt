A Boat Load of Home Folk (1968) is a novel by Australian author Thea Astley. == Plot summary == The novel follows a group of passengers on a cruise ship docked at a Pacific Island as a hurricane approaches. ==Critical reception== In The Canberra Times Liam Mason noted that the reader was able to sympathise with the novel's characters: "There is also an almost depressing realism in Miss Astley's resolutions of her characters' crises: the failure of a friend, the failure of a marriage, the failure of a priest, the failure (at the most trivial level) of a womaniser in a would-be seduction. For there is not necessarily any solution. Nor need there be a new start after the ritual of death and disaster.""Under the Surface of a Hot Summer" By Liam Mason, The Canberra Times, 7 September 1968, p14 Michael Wilding, writing in Southerly found a lot to like about the book, but also had some reservations: "The precision of the writing, the spareness and clarity, are immediately appealing. But as the novel progresses the lack of any substantial content lets the writing drift towards the somewhat consciously fine, and the religious referencesâ€”the recurrent calvaries, crucifixions and expiations, become obtrusive.""Writer and Reader" by Michael Wilding, Southerly, Vol 30, No 1, 1970, pp72-73 ==See also== * 1968 in literature ==References== Category:Novels by Thea Astley Category:1968 Australian novels Category:Angus & Robertson books
