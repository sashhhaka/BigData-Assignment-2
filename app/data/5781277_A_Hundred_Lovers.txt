A Hundred Lovers is the final album by the American band Timbuk 3. It was released in 1995. The title track was a minor radio hit. ==Production== Recorded by Timbuk 3 as a quartet, the album was produced by Pat MacDonald and Barbara K. The band used their home studio, as well as, for parts of one track, Jackson Browne's. "Legalize Our Love" is a pro-gay marriage song. ==Critical reception== Trouser Press wrote: "Irritation at the state of the world remains the order of the day, but messages come wrapped in vibrant, funky sounds." People determined that "the dance grooves get a little stale, but the MacDonalds still sound assured on acoustic gems like 'Prey'." The Calgary Herald deemed the album "proficient pop smothered in generic harmonies, guy-girl vocal trade-offs, smitten here and there by anemically funky riffs." The Vancouver Sun called it "a collection of catchy, folk-tinted pop numbers with an upbeat feel." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution concluded that "those who have always loved their cynically mellow attitude, deadpan harmonies and unrelenting wordplay will be delighted." ==Track listing== # "Sunshine Is Dangerous" # "A Hundred Lovers" # "Just Wanna Funk with Your Mind" # "Legalize Our Love" # "Cynical" # "Not Yet Gone" # "Prey" # "Shotgun Wedding" # "Kitchen Fire" # "Inside Out" ==References== Category:1995 albums Category:Timbuk 3 albums
