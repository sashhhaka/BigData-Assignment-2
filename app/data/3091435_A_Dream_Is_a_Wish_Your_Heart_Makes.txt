"A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" is a song written and composed by Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston for the Walt Disney film Cinderella (1950). In the song, Cinderella (voiced by Ilene Woods) encourages her animal friends to never stop dreaming, and that theme continues throughout the entire story. The song was inspired off of Franz Liszt’s Transcendental Etude No. 9 (Ricordanza). This song was also performed by Lily James for the soundtrack of the live-action version of Cinderella in 2015. In April 2020, Demi Lovato and Michael Bublé performed the song for The Disney Family Singalong on ABC. The song was also featured in the 2022 Disney+/Disney Channel original film Sneakerella, sung by Chosen Jacobs and Lexi Underwood. =="Dreams" as a recurring Disney theme== Thematically, the lyrics recall the sentiments expressed in "When You Wish Upon a Star" from Pinocchio (1940). In equating a dream with a wish, the song establishes that Cinderella is using the word "dream" in the metaphorical sense of desires that can, as the lyric promises, "come true." "When You Wish Upon A Star" makes this same promise, as does other Disney material, such as the fireworks show Remember... Dreams Come True and related promotions. The literal meaning of the word, as something that happens "when you're fast asleep", reappears in another Disney song, "Once Upon a Dream" from Sleeping Beauty (1959). ==Release== The original version appears on a CD of the original soundtrack, as well as several compilations. Ilene Woods with Harold Mooney and his Orchestra recorded the song in Hollywood on October 26, 1949. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 31-0014B (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog numbers B 9971, SG 272, HM 2753, JK 2679, SAB 7 and EA 3914\. The song has also been used as part of the opening titles of several iterations of the Walt Disney anthology television series, notably in the medley for The Wonderful World Of Disney (1969–1979) and in The Magical World Of Disney (1988). ==Certifications== ==Circle of Stars version== The song was re- recorded by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, a group of actors and actresses who have appeared in Disney Channel television series and original movies. The line-up was significantly different from that of their re- recording of "Circle Of Life" in 2003. This version was used in commercials for Disney on Ice from 2006 to 2010, and to launch the inflight music aboard international flights via Cebu Pacific airlines in December 2010. ===Track listing=== ;Digital track listing #"A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" (Single Version) – 3:55 #"A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" (Christmas Version) – 3:45 ===Official versions=== * "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" (Single Version) – 3:55 * "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" (Radio Edit) – 3:39 * "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" (Christmas Version) – 3:45 * "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" (Cut Live Version) – 1:21 ==References== Category:1950s ballads Category:1950 singles Category:1950 songs Category:Cinderella (franchise) Category:Disney songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs about dreams Category:Songs based on fairy tales Category:Songs written by Al Hoffman Category:Songs written by Jerry Livingston Category:Songs with lyrics by Mack David Category:Walt Disney Records singles
