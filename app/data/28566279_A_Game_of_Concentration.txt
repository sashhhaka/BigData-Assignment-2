A Game of Concentration (also known as Concentration and Hunt & Score) is a video game developed by Atari, Inc. and released in 1978 for the Atari VCS (later renamed to the Atari 2600). It was programmed by Jim Huether, and is a version of the classic memory game. It was one of a handful of games that used Atari's keypad controllers. The game was released by Sears for the "Sears Video Arcade" under the name Memory Match. ==Gameplay== thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot The game is played using a matrix of numbered panels, either 4 x 4 (for 16 panels) or 5 x 6 (for 30 panels). Using the keypad, players enter the number of the panels they wish to reveal. If the images behind the two panels match, the panels are removed and the player scores 1 or 2 points, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to, along with an extra turn. The game has a total of eight variations, four each for each matrix size and four have wild cards. Each matrix can be played by either a single player or by two players taking turns; in single-player games, the player attempts to clear the matrix with as few incorrect matches as possible. Also, players can enable wild cards that will match any image on the board. ==See also== *List of Atari 2600 games ==References== ==External links== *A Game of Concentration at Atari Mania Category:1978 video games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 2600-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Memory games
