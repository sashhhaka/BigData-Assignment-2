The film received a mixed reception from critics. Tv-maailma's review states that the "film laughs at Finnish national gloom as well as the desire to found the association, and the genre is stated to be mixed-strength opera buffa".AL: Päivän elokuvia. Tv- maailma 42/2012, p. 9. (in Finnish) Arto Pajukallio from Helsingin Sanomat stated that "the film's fun is mainly based on detached literary jokes, for which the actors cannot find an echo base".Pajukallio, Arto: Elokuvat, p.
