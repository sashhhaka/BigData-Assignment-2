Film Daily less favorably states, "A Boy Called Po might have the best of intentions, and Asher clearly meant well with it, but that doesn’t cure its cloying and saccharine tone, falling prey as it does to the same old autism fiction tropes." Dove.org considers: "Po is an inspiring story about a committed father, David Wilson (Christopher Gorham), and his love and concern for his autistic son, Patrick, fondly called “Po”." Movieguide.org states: "A Boy Called Po is an engaging, low budget movie with a strong, powerful climax. There are a few endings after the climax, but they each resolve several important issues. The heart of this movie is the relationship between the father and his son." == Awards == In 2016, the film won the Gold Remi Award at Worldfest Houston, the Festival Award for Breakthrough Feature at the San Diego International Film Festival, Best Feature at the Palm Beach International Film Festival, Outstanding Achievement in Filmmaking, Music, at the Newport Beach Film Festival, Best Actor (Julian Feder) at the Albuquerque Film & Music Experience, Best Actor (Julian Feder) at the Young Artists Awards as well as being nominated for many other accolades. == References == ==External links== Category:2016 films Category:2010s American films Category:2010s English-language films Category:American drama films Category:Films about autism Category:Films about father–son relationships Category:Films scored by Burt Bacharach
