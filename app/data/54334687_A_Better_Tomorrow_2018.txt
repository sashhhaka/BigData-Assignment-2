Idarklight of Cfensi, in her positive review of the film, wrote "From some of the boldest music choices to drastic switches in tone of cinematography to one of the most interesting shootout scenes in a while, A Better Tomorrow 2018 felt like a firework so bursting with life that it left me too busy savoring every minute details of brilliance to think about its flaws. You can just feel how much love and thought director Ding Sheng and the cast put into every scene. Even all the jokes avoid lazy one-liners but instead are all carefully set-up earlier to land perfectly." Pablo A. Tariman of Star Cinema praised the film and wrote, "The film delivers as a crime- action flick. The actors give their characters an earthy feel and they remain unscathed all throughout the bloodshed saga." Conversely, LP Hugo of Asia Film Strike gave the film a negative review, wrote "A solid crime drama on its own terms, A Better Tomorrow 2018 can however not sustain comparison with the original. But despite a wavering tone, some heavy-handed references, it still manages to introduce interesting variations, and benefits from Wang Kai’s charisma." Sean Gilman of MUBI Notebook Column, wrote "There’s nothing especially unusual about a bland, over-edited and undercooked crime movie. And without the A Better Tomorrow connection Ding Sheng’s film would barely be noticed among the sea of mediocrity that is mainstream Mainland cinema." ===Accolades=== A Better Tomorrow 2018 received two nominations at the 4th Annual International Jackie Chan Action Movie Week, one for Best Movie Stunt and one for Best New Actor In Action for Wang Talu. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2018 films Category:Chinese action films Category:Chinese crime drama films Category:2010s crime drama films Category:Sparkle Roll Media films Category:Films directed by Ding Sheng Category:Yakuza films Category:2018 drama films Category:2010s Mandarin-language films Category:2010s Japanese films
