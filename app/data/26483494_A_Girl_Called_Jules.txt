He began exploring other genres and was initially interested in adapting Livia De Stefani's novel Black Grapes. The original story of Black Grapes involved gangsters, a topic that became popular in Italy after the release of Damiano Damiani's The Day of the Owl. Valerii was introduced to producer Francesco Mazzei by Riz Ortolani. When approaching him for Black Grapes, Mazzei countered the offer to film an adaptation of La ragazza di nome Giulio. Screenplay credits on the actual film prints state that Marcello Coscia, Bruno Di Geronimo, Maurio Di Nardo, Francesco Mazzei and Valerii are responsible for the film's screenplay. Valerii disregarded this stating that these people "did not actually write the film!" and that the film was written by Giuseppe Murgia and Beppe Bellecca. Joan Fontaine was originally cast to play Laura, the title character's mother, but she left the set a few days before the end of shooting due to economic disagreements with the producer Francesco Mazzei;Roberto Curti, Il mio nome è Nessuno.
