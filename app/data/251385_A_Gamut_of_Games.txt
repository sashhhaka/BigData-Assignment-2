A Gamut of Games is an innovative book of games written by Sid Sackson and first published in 1969. It contains rules for a large number of paper and pencil, card, and board games. Many of the games in the book had never before been published. It is considered by many hobbyist gamers to be an essential text for anyone interested in abstract strategy games, and a number of the rules were later expanded into full-fledged published board games. Some of the games which were later sold separately include Focus, Property and Origins of World War I; Robert Abbott expanded his game Crossings, published here, into the more-refined title Epaminondas. Many of the games covered in the book were creations of Sid Sackson himself, who was a prolific game designer. ==Book Sections== The sections of the book and the games covered therein are as follows: ===In Search of Big and Little Games=== *Blue and Gray, a board game by Henry Busch and Arthur Jaeger *Hekaton, a card game originally published along with "Yankee Notion Cards" from the 19th century *Le Truc, a revived French card game *Mate, a card game by G.
