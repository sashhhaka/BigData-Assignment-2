Like the first novel in the series, this book is narrated by Guy Langton and concerns the younger son Dominic, a man who ideals and actions are considered both eccentric and unacceptable to the Melbourne society of the time. ==Reviews== Gordon Stewart in The Argus noted that the author was now in fine company. "Few authors can cope successfully with the family saga type of sage. Miles Franklin and Henry Handel Richardson stand out among the Australians who have made the attempt. To their names can now be added that of Martin Boyd, for the sensitive appeal and literary skill of his latest novel "A Difficult Young Man." He then goes on "The entire work has an air of reality and authenticity which one associates usually only with autobiography.""Local Boy Has Skill" The Argus, 30 July 1955, p44 Dorothy Green, writing in 1965 after the book had been re- issued, stated: "This book is a sharp and timely reminder that other values than commercial success once counted for something in our urban environment, values in no way inferior to, and in some respects superior to those be longing to the European culture with which our own is compared and contrasted. There are unmistakable signs that in this comparatively late novel, Boyd, after sitting agonised for so long on the fence that divides his two worlds has put his foot down on the southern side of it.""Sounding Boyd's distinctive style" by Dorothy Green, The Canberra Times, 13 November 1965, p13 == Awards and nominations == * 1957 â€“ winner ALS Gold Medal == See also == * Merric Boyd - the article intimates that Merric Boyd might have been a model for the novel's lead character ==References== Category:1955 Australian novels Category:Novels by Martin Boyd Category:ALS Gold Medal winning works Category:Novels set in Melbourne Category:Cresset Press books
