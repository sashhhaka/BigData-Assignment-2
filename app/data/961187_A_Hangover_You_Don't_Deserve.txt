A Hangover You Don't Deserve is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bowling for Soup. It was released on September 14, 2004, as their third album with Jive Records. The first single, "1985", quickly became a Top 40 staple, peaking at No. 5 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. ==Critical reception== Johnny Loftus, writing for AllMusic, praised the catchability of the first three tracks and Jaret Reddick's songwriting on songs like "Ohio (Come Back to Texas)", but was critical of the album containing typical pop punk production ("stuff like piano breaks, compressed vocals, and steppe farm chorus guitars") that made the band sound too close to similar bands like Goldfinger and Lit, saying that "most of the time it's very hard to hear Bowling for Soup around Hangovers radio and video-ready sheen." Entertainment Weekly writer Brian Hiatt felt that tracks like "1985" were not enough to sustain a whole album, saying that, "Like a lower-SATs version of Fountains of Wayne, the Texas quartet tries to write silly/clever lyrics to go atop their high-carb pop melodies. But too much of the humor (rhyming "Miss Texas" with "bigger breast- es"?) functions on a Jackass: The Band level." ==Track listing== Each version of the album, excluding the DualDisc version, has a number of tracks that are four to five seconds of complete silence, titled "[Blank]", between the last song and "Ohio (Reprise)". The number of tracks varies upon the version, but "Ohio (Reprise)" and "Belgium (Boy Band Remix)" are tracks 43 and 44 respectively on all versions. ===DualDisc version=== CD side * Tracks 1–17 of standard edition DVD side * Entire album in 5.1 Surround Sound (including "Ohio (Reprise)" and "Belgium" (Boy Band Remix) as tracks 18 and 19 respectively) * Entire album In Stereo PCM * "1985" (video) * "Almost" (video) * "Ridiculous" (video) * "Two-Seater" (acoustic) (video from RollingStone.com Originals) ===B-sides=== ==Personnel== Bowling for Soup: * Jaret Reddick — lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Erik Chandler — bass guitar, vocals * Chris Burney — lead guitar, vocals * Gary Wiseman — drums, percussion Production: * Co-Produced by Russ-T Cobb and Jaret Reddick except * and ** ** Produced by Butch Walker * Recorded and Mixed at Ruby Red Productions Atlanta, Georgia * Engineered and mixed by Russ-T Cobb except ** * Assistant Engineer: Sean Loughlin * Project Coordinator: Christie Priode *** Produced by Jaret Reddick Casey Diiorio : Recorded and Mixed by Casey Diiorio at Valve Studios, Dallas, Texas * Tracks 1 and 3 Mixed by Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studios, Miami, Florida * Mastered by Chaz Harper at Battery Mastering NYC * album photography by Jason Janik Additional Musicians/Backing Vocals: * Butch Walker * Russ-T Cobb * Joey Huffman * FFroe * Howie * Sim Klugerman * Sean Loughlin * JT Hall * Shelly Truesdell * Candice Leigh Andrews * Sybil Summers as the "ex" in "Down For The Count" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2004) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2005) Position US Billboard 200 185 ===Singles=== Year Single Chart Position 2004 "1985" Adult Top 40 5 The Billboard Hot 100 23 Top 40 Mainstream 10 Top 40 Tracks 13 ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * A Hangover You Don't Deserve at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2004 albums Category:Jive Records albums Category:Bowling for Soup albums Category:Albums produced by Butch Walker
