A Beautiful Exchange is the nineteenth album in the live praise and worship series of contemporary worship by Hillsong Church. It was recorded at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Hillsong Church in Australia by Reuben Morgan, Darlene Zschech, Joel Houston and the Hillsong Worship Team. The album was released in the United States on 29 June 2010 in partnership with EMI. These worship songs explore themes including sacrifice and redemption ("Beautiful Exchange"), love ("Our God Is Love") and hope ("Forever Reign"), which is also the first radio single. Hillsong Live albums are led by worship leaders including Reuben Morgan, Joel Houston, Ben Fielding and Darlene Zschech. Other key songs include: "Open My Eyes" (sung by Reuben Morgan), "The One Who Saves" (sung by Ben Fielding) and "Greatness Of Our God" (sung by Darlene Zschech). Many of the songs were written by Reuben Morgan with other authors such as Jason Ingram, Stu Garrard, Ben Fielding and Darlene Zschech. On 9 July 2010 the album debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard Christian Albums Chart and at No. 40 on the US Billboard 200 chart. During the initial week on the charts it remained in the top 3. And this was also the last official album to feature Brooke Fraser as a worship leader until her return to Hillsong Worship six years later (with the release of the band's 2016 live album "Let There Be Light") ==Track listing (CD)== Song Author Worship Leader Supporting Vocal Duration Our God Is Love Joel Houston, Scott Ligertwood Joel Houston 4:04 Open My Eyes Reuben Morgan, Braden Lang Reuben Morgan 4:02 Forever Reign Jason Ingram, Reuben Morgan Jad Gillies 5:43 The One Who Saves Ben Fielding Ben Fielding Darlene Zschech 6:24 Like Incense / Sometimes by Step Brooke Fraser / David Strasser, Rich Mullins Brooke Fraser Jad Gillies, Annie Garratt 7:41 The Greatness Of Our God Jason Ingram, Stu Garrard, Reuben Morgan Darlene Zschech Marcus Temu (DVD) 5:49 / 6:24 (DVD) The Father's Heart Jorim Kelly, Gio Galanti Jorim Kelly None 6:04 You Joel Houston Joel Houston 4:29 Love Like Fire Matt Crocker Matt Crocker None 6:16 Believe Reuben Morgan, Darlene Zschech Darlene Zschech Jad Gillies 4:16 / 6:00 (DVD) Beautiful Exchange Joel Houston Joel Houston, Annie Garratt 10:43 Thank You Ben Fielding, Reuben Morgan Reuben Morgan Jad Gillies, Jill McCloghry 5:25 Forever Reign (Radio Version) Jason Ingram, Reuben Morgan Jad Gillies None 4:09 ==Track listing (DVD/Blu-Ray)== # "You" # "Open My Eyes" # "Forever Reign" # "The One Who Saves" # "Like Incense / Sometimes by Step" # "The Greatness of Our God" # "The Father's Heart" # "Our God Is Love" # "Love Like Fire" # "Believe" # "Thank You" # "Beautiful Exchange" ===Bonus features=== "Documentary: A Beautiful Exchange – Behind the Screens" Hillsong London # "The Answer" (Reuben Morgan and Braden Lang) Worship leader: Peter Wilson # "God Our Salvation" (Jay Cook and Dave Tymoszuk) Worship leader: Jay Cook # "For All You Are / You Are Good" (David Kennedy / Dave George) Worship leader: Ingrid Boe-Kennedy, Jay Cook / Juliet Adekambi # "All Things New" (Dave George and Tim Steer) Worship leader: Dave George # "Glorious One / To Bring You Glory" (Reuben Morgan and Jay Cook / Dave Tymoszuk) Worship leader: Jay Cook ==Reception== Ryan Barbee of Jesus Freak Hideout said the highlight of the album is Brooke Fraser's "Like Incense/Sometimes By Step" and called it "one of the most intimate tracks Hillsong has put out to date". He also wrote: A Beautiful Exchange has some very powerful moments and some weak ones. However, we as listeners are outsiders looking in. You might not find everything you're looking for in [it] but you'll definitely find a heart of worship." Kim Jones of About.com called the album "beautiful, warm and intimate" and concluded, "A Beautiful Exchange will suck you in and deliver you to the feet of your Savior - and your day will be all the better for it." ===Awards=== The album was nominated for two Dove Awards: Praise & Worship Album of the Year and Long Form Music Video of the Year, at the 42nd GMA Dove Awards.42nd Annual GMA Dove Awards Nominees on DoveAwards.com ==Personnel== Worship leaders: *Darlene Zschech – senior worship leader, senior lead vocal, songwriter *Reuben Morgan – worship pastor, worship leader, frontline singer, songwriter, producer *Joel Houston – creative director, worship leader, frontline singer, songwriter, producer *Brooke Fraser – worship leader, frontline singer, songwriter *Jad Gillies – worship leader, frontline singer *Annie Garratt – worship leader, frontline singer *Matt Crocker – worship leader, songwriter *Ben Fielding – worship leader, frontline singer, songwriter *Jorim Kelly \- worship leader *Peter Wilson \- worship leader (bonus feature only) *Jay Cook \- worship leader (bonus feature only) *Dave George \- worship leader (bonus feature only) *Ingrid Boe-Kennedy \- worship leader (bonus feature only) *Juliet Adekambi \- worship leader (bonus feature only) Frontline singers: *Jonathon Douglass *Jill McCloghry *Mia Fieldes *Braden Lang *David Ware *Laura Toganivalu *Marcus Temu *David Hodgson *Sheila Gallegos *Andy Barrow *Terrence Ryan *Tristan Perdriau *Joanna Norden *Jessie Malcolm *Michelle Grigg *Collena Gillespie *Sherrod Dine *Niki Carless *Billy Conway Music directors: *Autumn Hardman *Nigel Hendroff Drums: *Brandon Gillies, Simon Kobler, Rolf Wam Fjell Bass: *Adam Crosariol, Ntando "Bob" Mpofu, Matt Tennikoff, Ben Whincop Electric guitars: *Ben Fielding, Nigel Hendroff, Timon Klein, Isaac Soon, Dylan Thomas, Jorim Kelly and Reuben Morgan Acoustic guitars: *Matt Crocker, Ben Fielding, Jad Gillies, Nigel Hendroff, Joel Houston, Brooke Ligertwood, Reuben Morgan, Peter Wilson Keyboards: *David Andrew, Autumn Hardman, Peter James, Dave George Violins: *Hanna Crezee, Lauren Hodges Cello: *Jared Dahl Trombone: *Marc Warry French Horn: *Elizabeth Gorringe Trumpet: *Tim Whincop String arrangements on "Believe" by: *Vanessa James Choir: *Hillsong Church Choir Senior Pastors: *Brian and Bobbie Houston Worship Pastor: *Reuben Morgan Album Cover *'The X Concept' Cover Artwork Depicts: Reuben Morgan & Darlene Zschech == Instruments == * Nigel Hendroff: Duesenberg guitars * Ben Fielding: Duesenberg guitars and Collings guitars * Timon Klein: Gretsch guitars * Dylan Thomas: Fender guitars * Jorim Kelly: Gretsch guitars * Isaac Soon: Gibson guitars * Reuben Morgan: Rickenbacker guitars and Martin guitars * Joel Houston: Martin guitars * Jad Gillies: Gibson guitars * Brooke (Fraser) Ligertwood: Taylor guitars * Matt Crocker: Martin guitars * Ntando "Bob" Mpofu: Lakland basses ==Charts== Chart (2010) Peak position U.S. Billboard 200 40 U.S. Billboard Christian Albums 1 U.S. Billboard Digital Albums 9 ARIA Top 50 Albums Chart (Australia) 3 ;Year-end charts Chart (2010) Position US Billboard Christian Albums 37 ==References== Category:2010 live albums Category:2010 video albums Category:Live video albums Category:Hillsong Music live albums Category:Hillsong Music video albums
