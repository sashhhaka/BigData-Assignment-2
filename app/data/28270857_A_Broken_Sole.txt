A Broken Sole is a 2006 trilogy of short films directed by Antony Marsellis and written by Susan Charlotte, dealing with the September 11 attacks in 2001. ==Plot== Based on three short plays by Susan Charlotte, the film follows the lives of six characters: a shoemaker and his customer, a taxi driver and his passenger, and a dyslexic director and his date. ===The Shoemaker=== On September 11, 2001, a shoemaker (Danny Aiello) is frantic to close his shop early.

Danny Aiello would reprise this role off-broadway in 2010 and 2011 in The Shoemaker. ===The Cabbie=== In October 2001 a nervous real-estate broker (Laila Robins) takes a ride with an over-enunciating cab driver (Bob Dishy). ===The Dyslexic Lover=== In December 2001 Nan (Margaret Colin), an actress who supports herself with a job at a travel agency and Bob (John Shea), a dyslexic director try to come to terms with their on-again, off-again relationship. ==Cast== * Danny Aiello - The Shoemaker * Margaret Colin - Nan * Bob Dishy - Cabbie * Judith Light - Hilary * Laila Robins - Passenger * Rebekkah Ross - Louise's Voice (voice) * John Shea - Bob ==Score== An original composition by Philip Glass appears in this film, originally commissioned by Susan Charlotte for the short film; Love Divided By.
