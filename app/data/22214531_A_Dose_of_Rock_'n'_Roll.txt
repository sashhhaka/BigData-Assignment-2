"A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll" is a song written by Carl Groszman, who at the time was signed to Ringo Starr's record label, Ring O' Records. Starr released his own recording of the song on his 1976 album Ringo's Rotogravure. Also issued as the album's lead single, it became his first hit as an Atlantic Records artist. Released on 20 September 1976 in advance of the album in the US, the single spent nine weeks on the Billboard charts, peaking at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was released in the UK on 15 October but failed to chart there. Record World said that it "marks a return to the goodtime, sing-along style" and that "Peter Frampton adds some spicy guitar licks." ==Personnel== Musician Instrument Peter Frampton Guitar Jesse Ed Davis Danny Kortchmar Klaus Voormann Bass guitar Dr. John Keyboards Randy Brecker Trumpet Alan Rubin Michael Brecker Tenor saxophone George Young Lewis Delgatto Baritone saxophone ==References== ; Footnotes ; Citations ==External links== *Allmusic.com Category:1976 singles Category:Ringo Starr songs Category:Songs written by Carl Groszman Category:Year of song missing Category:1976 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Polydor Records singles
