A Funny Mahometan () was an 1897 short silent comedy film directed by Georges Méliès. It was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 94 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a scène comique. The film was shot outside in the garden of Méliès's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, with painted scenery. Méliès himself played the Muslim of the title. A Funny Mahometan, with its presumably Algerian Muslim, is the first known film on an Algerian topic in cinema history. The film is currently presumed lost. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:1897 films Category:Lost French films Category:French comedy short films Category:French silent short films Category:French black-and-white films Category:1897 comedy films Category:1890s lost films Category:1897 short films Category:Silent comedy films Category:1890s French films Category:Films about Islam
